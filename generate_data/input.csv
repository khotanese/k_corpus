Compare the ‘53 men, (including both) the commissioned and the non-commissioned’ in Archive 3/6.3 §4, the 58 men in Archive 3/1.7 §4, and the 52 men ‘according to the register’ in Archive 3/6.7 §4.%§3 ttāguttāṃ haudi śeṃgāṃ ṣaṃgna: ‘by the Tibetan seven-śeṃga ṣaṃga’. In the Tibetan system, one ṣaṃga equals to 7-śeṃga. Here, the issuer explicitly reminds the recipient of the Tibetan measurements, because Sudārrjāṃ confuses the Tibetan seven-śeṃga ṣaṃga with the Chinese 10-śeṃga ṣaṃga in his calculation of grain in Archive 3/1.7. See introduction to Archive 3/1.7.%§4 600 [30] [kūsa] 7 ṣaṃga: ‘630 kūsas 7 ṣaṃgas’. 11.9 kūsas per man × 53 men = 630.7 kūsas.%§6 [100 80] 4 kūsa ganaṃ: ‘184 kūsas of wheat’. 630.7 − 225.4 − 221.3 = 184.%§10 visarrjāṃ 50 2: ‘Visarrjāṃ, 52 (years old)’.

Mattiśka, Dumesala, Suhīka, and Bikina are villages in Birgaṃdara. Mattiśka is also in Archive 3/3.6 §14, Archive 3/5.3 §5, and Archive 3/5.22 §2. In Archive 3, Dumesala is only attested here, but it is in BH 5-1, a newly-discovered wooden document in Khotanese. See Duan 2015, p.146. Suhīka is also in Archive 3/4.6a §2, Archive 3/4.6p §2, Archive 3/5.3 §3, and Archive 3/5.22 §2.

This village is only attested here in Archive 3.%§17 [āsk]u[ī]ra: ‘In Askūra’, parallel to ‘In Birgaṃdara’ in §15, ‘in Pa’’ in §16, and ‘In Phaṃnai’ in §18. A more common form is āskvīra, such as āskvīra śī’laṃ ‘Śī’laṃ from Āskūra’ in Archive 3/4.13d §2. Wen Xin (2008b, p.117, n.40) could not reconstruct this word and made a wrong conjecture.%§17 puñiśela: puñiśāla-, L.s., a village in Āskūra, attested again as puñaśālyā in Archive 3/3.11 §6.%§17 ba’sä vī: ‘upon ba’sa’. meaning unclear.%§18 kulą̄ña, buttaką̄ña: ‘From Kula’, ‘from Buttaka’.

Vorob’ëva-Desjatovkaja (1996, p.174) renders this word as ‘servant’. Yoshida (2006, pp.120-122) translates it as ‘half-dependent’. The meaning of ‘the commissioned man, servant’ fits the context here well. Makala used to be the commissioned man of Sudārrjāṃ and was thus exempt from the canteen duty. Naṃdaka now replaces Makala and becomes Sudārrjāṃ’s new commissioned man. As a result, the canteen duty imposed on Naṃdaka should be transferred to Makala. As can be seen from the context, paśā ‘the commissioned man’ is more like a job or task rather than a fixed social status.%§7 spaśa{ña}ñāṣṭi: ‘to the patrols’. The first ña is deleted and the resulting form spaśañāṣṭi is what one expects.%§7 gvāri yuḍe: ‘he made a complaint’. This legal term means ‘to bring a lawsuit against someone’.%§8 pyaḍai: pyaḍa- ‘to reject, turn down’, pf. 2s. As is made clear in §4, Naṃdaka has now replaced Makala to be the commissioned man. Consequently, Naṃdaka’s patrol duty should be done by Makala. Naṃdaka made a complaint before Sāṃdara concerning the patrol duty, but Sāṃdara rejected his request and put him on the canteen duty. Then Naṃdaka turned to Sudārrjuṃ for help. Sudārrjuṃ supported him and issued this order to transfer Naṃdaka’s canteen duty to Makala.%§9 hatcaste: hatcy- hatcasta- ‘to be broken, to be substituted’, pf. 3s., other forms are attested in Archive 3/1.25 §8, Archive 3/1.32 §14.

This is the end of the quoted order, in which Sudārrjāṃ demands Sāṃdara to send both the commissioned and the noncommissioned to do canteen duty in Cira, and ignore the work assigned to the commissioned.%§12 haysīru: hays- ‘to send’, opt. 2p.%§14 haṣḍi yuḍi: ‘to make a petition’, pf. 3sg. This sentence is not the dating formula, which should be at the end of the petition, but a reference to a previous petition made by someone else, perhaps Ṣanīra. Thus the date of the petition must fall between the date mentioned here (9/18) and the date of the order in response (9/21).%§15 haṃdāḍa-y-[ū]: ‘reaped for you’. haṃdār-, haṃdāḍa, ‘to bring together, to reap’. Skjærvø (Catalogue, p.92) reads yu, but the lower end of the akṣara is missing. The long tail of -ū, the expected second person singular enclitic, is probably in the lacuna. %v:%§3 thaiṣī: ‘Commissioner-in-chief’, referring to the military commander of the garrison stationed in the Fort of Phema, corresponding to Chin. dàshǐ 大使 (Yoshida 2006, p.23 and 2008a, p.468), Tib. the śi (Rong 1993, p.413), MMP ṯ’yšy (Yoshida 1994, p.371, not dàshī 大師 as he suggests there). This is one of the Chinese titles adopted by the Khotanese. Other such titles include Khot. phąna kvana ~ Chin. pànguān 判官, Khot. cāṃṣṣī ~ Chin. zhǎngshǐ 長史, and Khot. tsīṣī ~ Chin. cìshǐ 刺史. See commentary on Archive 3/1.1 §8 (C) and Archive 3/1.2 §2.%§3 bulā(ni) rmąmi [śä’räna]: ‘Blon Rmang-[bzher]’, also attested in Archive 3/1.12 §11, Archive 3/1.22 §13, Archive 3/1.34 §1, Archive 3/1.42 §1, Archive 3/1.43 §1 (restored), and Archive 3/6.2 §1. As hinted by Skjærvø (Catalogue, p.87), this Tibetan military officer is attested again in Or.15000/33, a Tibetan document from Mazar Tagh (Or.15000/33 = M.Tagh. 0512, see Takeuchi 1998, p.28, n.87, and TLTD II, p.410). Yoshida (2006, pp.74-76, and 2008a, pp. 468-469) identifies him with Lùn Mǎngrè 論莽熱, a Tibetan general captured by Tang forces in 802 in Nanzhao, in present-day Yunnan, but the latter was already active in Nanzhao in 794 (XTS, v216b). A similar name blon Rma-bzher attested in a Tibetan document from Miran (TLTD II, pp.413-14) shows that this name was fairly common at that time. Therefore, Yoshida’s identification is probably incorrect. It can be inferred from Archive 3/1.34 §3 that blon Rmang-bzher was residing in Phema, thus he was most likely the commander of the garrison at the Fort of Phema. He would not be the commander in charge of the entire Khotan region as suggested by Yoshida (2006, p.24), since the headquarters of the Tibetan administration in Khotan were located in the citadel at Shenshan, present-day Mazar-Tagh, as demonstrated by the numerous Tibetan documents discovered there. (Takeuchi 2004, p.55) Blon Rmang-bzher was certainly not the Military Commissioner (tcirrtū, jiédù 節度) as suggested by Yoshida (2006, p.76), since the name of the Military Commissioner is attested in Archive 3/1.2 §3 as lųnä ha’bäśi’rä ‘Blon Lha bzher’.%§3 vaña thaiṣī bulā(ni) rmąmi [śä’räna parau ā sä]: ‘Now, [an order has come from] the Commissioner-in-chief blon Rmang-[bzher, (saying)]’.

For more on him, see introduction of Archive 3/1.41.%§4 māśa-vīrā: māśa-vīraa-, ‘house-worker, dependent’, from *māśa-kīraa-, also attested in Archive 3/4.5p §3, Archive 3/4.5r §2, Archive 3/6.3 §5, and Archive 3/6.7 §5. According to Archive 3/6.7 §5, there are 15 ‘house-workers of the king’ in the 33rd regnal year. Wen Xin (2008a, p. 125) first identified this term with Chin. jiārén 家人, ‘person of the household, dependent’, attested in Archive 3/2.8 §2 (C), and multiple times as dependents of a Buddhist temple in Or. 8211/969-972 (MT.b.009), a long Chinese document dated to 721 CE.

Yoshida (2006, p.124), following Vorob’ëva- Desjatovskaya (1996, pp.174-175), suggests that stānaḍa refers to an official on the village level, comparable to chaupaṃ. His argument, however, is based on a flawed interpretation of Hedin 18 (Archive 3/6.7). See commentary on Archive 3/6.7 §10. The meaning stānaḍa can also be demonstrated in Archive 3/1.41 §2: cira kṣvā auvā stānaḍāṃ vara u hamīḍa pa’kisanāṃ vara ‘to the superior teachers in Cira-Six Towns and all the commoners’, or, ‘to the monks and the laymen’, including everyone in the prefecture.%§8 [yuḍä yīṃdä]: yan- ‘to do’, pres. 3s., potential construction, restored according to the context.%§9 haṃdira prū: ‘the Inner Court’, also attested in a similar context in Archive 3/1.13 §7.

Skjærvø (Catalogue, p. 98) reads: ‘d[rr]ai chā -i tsuna’. Here I follow Duan’s reading in Duan 2013a, p.323, because it fits the figures well. According to Archive 3/3.4 §10, five men in Āskūra should deliver 3.2 × 5 = 16 feet of small cloth, exactly the amount specified here in §7. If 3.2 feet of small cloth at the price of 450 mūrās per foot (Archive 3/3.4 §8) can replace 23 feet of floss silk cloth (Archive 3/3.2 §2), then the price of floss silk cloth is (450 × 3.2) ÷ 23 = 62. 61 ≈ 62.5 mūrās per foot, or 62.5 × 40 = 2500 mūrās per bolt. Duan (2013a, p.324) first makes this calculation and traces the fluctuation of cloth price in Khotan during the seventh to the ninth centuries. In Archive 3/3.4 §8, however, the small cloth assigned to each man is increased from 3.2 feet to 3.65 feet. For an explanation of this increase, see commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §8.%§5 4suhena thau vāra paṃjsa chā: ‘Suhena owes five feet of cloth.’ Namaubuda delivered 36.2 feet of cloth on behalf of Suhena and Sūradatta (Archive 3/3.1 §22), so Suhena and Suradatta owe about 5 feet each. See commentary on Archive 3/3.1 §22.%§6 sūradatti thau vāra paṃ[jsa chā …]: ‘Sūradatta owes five feet of cloth.’ Sūradatta later dilivered the cloth assigned to him, see Archive 3/2.17 §2.%§8 phaṃnājāṃ nva thaunakāṃ ha[tca 10 2 chā 8 tsuna]: ‘For those from Phaṃnai, (the silk cloth is) replaced by [12.8] feet of small cloth.’ According to Archive 3/3.4 §8, the equivalent of 31.8 feet of small cloth is assigned to those from Phaṃnai and Pa’. 19 feet is assigned to those from Pa’ (§9), then 31.8 − 19 = 12.8 feet must be assigned to those from Phaṃnai. Since 3.2 feet is assigned to each (§3), there must be 4 men in Phaṃnai who should deliver small cloth. The restoration is based on Duan 2013a, p.324. Also see commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §8.%§9 [pa’ja nva] thaunakāṃ hatcaṃ nausä chā: ‘[For those from Pa’], (the silk cloth is) replaced by 19 feet of small cloth.’ According to Archive 3/3.4 §8, the equivalent of 31.8 feet of small cloth is assigned to those from Phaṃnai and Pa’. Since the small cloth assigned to those from Phaṃnai is recorded in §8, so the 19 feet of small cloth recorded here must be assigned to those from Pa’. 19 feet is 0.2 feet short of the amount assigned to 6 men (3.2 × 6 = 19.2).

This name is also attested in Archive 3/1.8 §1, spelt as ṣau ani kuki syini. The sum of 44000 mūrās can be linked with two payments, one of 3000 mūrās (Archive 3/2.1), the other of 40000 mūrās (Archive 3/2.2 and Archive 3/3.1 §25). These two payments, 43000 mūrās in total, were made to ṣau An Sam. Both An Kuh-syin and An Sam are most likely Chinese names of Sogdians bearing the surname Ān 安, the surname assumed by Bukharan Sogdians. A similar name, Ān Dáhàn 安達漢, is attested in Дх 18925 (Zhang and Rong 2002, p.230), a Chinese document from Dandan-Uiliq in the Russian Collection.

As the entire document requires Sudārrjaṃ to sign three times, he used the shorthand signum for the first two, and the formal one for the last.

In Or.11252/34.1, Sudārrjaṃ issued the rosters of Patrol 17 to Patrol 19, but did not specified the date of Patrol 18 and Patrol 19. Instead, he used ‘the second būka’ and ‘the third būka’ to refer to the team of Patrol 18 and Patrol 19 respectively. The first būka in Sudārrjaṃ’s mind must then be the team of Patrol 17. The three būkas refer to three teams on patrol duty on three different dates, not three teams on the same day, as Yoshida (2006, p.116) understands it. As shown in Table IV-13 in Chapter IV, one team is made up of nine to 19 people. %1-iii:%§2 pa’ sudatti: ‘Sudatta from Pa’’.

This word is also attested in contexts related to money in SI P 103.10 (SDTV III, p.138) and IOL Khot 44/5 (Catalogue, p.275). It probably refers to a communal granary.%§6 ga[naṃ haurīda 2 kū]sa 3 ṣaṃga: ‘They [will deliver 2] kūsa 3 ṣaṃga of wheat.’ Restored according to ganaṃ haurīda dva kūsa kṣi ṣaga ‘they will deliver 2 kūsa 6 ṣaṃga of wheat’ in §7.

See bāja- in Studies III, pp.112-114.%§2 śarkāṃ bāja vaśi’raki jsātä: ‘Vaśi’raka goes instead of Śarkāṃ’. The formula A bāja B jsātä ‘B goes instead ofA’, betrays the existence of a general patrol schedule, and records a slight change of it before the patrol day. In contrast, the formula A bāja B tsve ‘B went instead ofA’ records a change in the actual patrol and is used in retrospective rosters.%§2 śarkāṃ bāja vaśi’raki jsātä [budadatti su]dattä: Restored from Archive 3/4.5r §2: ‘vaśi’raki || budadatti || āskvī(ra) sudatti’.%§2 phāji cira: ‘Phāja from Cira’. Phāja did not go on patrol, as his name is absent in Archive 3/4.5r. He was rescheduled to the next patrol and did go on duty in Patrol 6, as his name is in Archive 3/4.6p and Archive 3/4.6r.%§3 svarrnade māśa-vīrai [vasade ||]{śarkāṃ} māśa-vīrai || sūrade: Restored from Archive 3/4.5r §2: ‘svarrnadi bāja vidyadatti tsve || {maṃgali} || suradi bāja kāśaki tsve’ and ‘vasadi bāja maṃgali tsve ||’. According to the retrospective roster, Vidyadatta, Maṃgala, and Kāśaka went on patrol as substitutes for Svarrnade, Vasade, and Sūrade. Therefore, the name missing in the prospective roster between Svarrnade and Sūrade must be Vasade.%§3 saṃgapuñi ||: According to Archive 3/4.5r, Saṃgapuña did not go on duty in Patrol 5. He did not go on duty in Patrol 6 either, as his name is present, but deleted in Archive 3/4.6p, and not in Archive 3/4.6r. He finally went on duty in Patrol 9, as in Archive 3/4.9p §2.%§3 {vidarrjāṃ}: Vidarrjāṃ is deleted because Svarrnade is going on his behalf. See commentary on §4 below.%§3 haubarai sīhai: ‘Haubarai Sīhai’. Haubarai is a rarely attested title. Apart from Sīhai, only Ttirikvira bears this title, as in Archive 3/5.20 §4, the only document where Sīhai is attested again. See commentary on Archive 3/5.20 §3.%§3 salamai haubarai sīhai hīvī: ‘Salamai belonging to haubarai Sīhai’. Salamai, as a dependent of Sīhai, is of a lower social status. Salamai did not go on duty in Patrol 5, as his name is not in Archive 3/4.5r. He was rescheduled to attend the next patrol, but this shift was canceled again, since his name is present, but deleted in Archive 3/4.6p and is not in Archive 3/4.6r. He is not attested again in other patrol rosters.%§3 buttaṃdai māśa-vīrai [suhadā]ysä māśa-vīrai || {x x} nahvąnä: Restored from Archive 3/4.5r §2: ‘bu[ttaṃdai ||] suhadāysi \māśa-vīrai/’ || nahvąni.%§4 vidarrjāṃ bāja svarrnade jsātä: ‘Svarrnade goes instead ofVidarrjāṃ’. This sentence accounts for the absence of Vidarrjāṃ in Archive 3/4.5r. It also explains the faint circle, a mark of deletion, around ‘vidarrjāṃ’ in §3. The handwriting of this sentence is different from the rest of the text, but similar to the signum. The scribe listed both Svarrnade and Vidarrjāṃ earlier in the roster, but Sudārrjāṃ, when signing the document, realized that Vidarrjāṃ would not go because Svarrnade was going on his behalf, so he added this sentence after his signum and drew a circle around Vidarrjāṃ in the roster. %b:%§4 puṣa: ‘completely’.

The actual instruction of the order is only one sentence long. The main clause should be in the imperative followed by an adverbial clause of purpose introduced by the conjunction khu. The length of the lacunae, about nine to ten akṣaras long, as determined by the restoration of §1, does not allow khu to introduce a conditional clause followed by a main clause, as Skjærvø (Catalogue, p.103) takes it.%§6 kaśti: ‘to fall’, from kas- pres. 3s. %v:%§1 [@ thaiṣī bulāni rmąmi śi’]rä tta parī: ‘[The Commissioner-in-chief blon Rmang bzher] orders thus’, restored according to Archive 3/1.42 §1: ‘thai[ṣ]ī bulāni rmąmi śi’rä tta parī’. This restoration also establishes the original line length of the document, thus providing clues for further restorations. Skjærvø’s restoration ‘[@ spāta ṣan]īrä’ (Catalogue, p.103) is unlikely, because the Tibetan phrase at the end requires a Tibetan issuer.

The expected form is śärä. Perhaps the scribe had in mind śera ganama.%§4 yau[varāyāṣṭi kharrjāṃ paśa]: ‘[Send Kharrjāṃ to the Young King]’. Not many words start with yau-, so one is not left with many options when it comes to restoration. Skjærvø reconstructs ‘yau[dar- ? ……]’. (Catalogue, p.103) My restoration, however, is based on the following: 1) Kharrjāṃ is attested in Archive 3/5.13 §10 as belonging to yauvarāya, ‘the Young King’; 2) three ‘wheat-sowers’ are attested in Archive 3/5.20 §5 as belonging to the Young King; 3) an order must end with an imperative; 4) there must be eight akṣaras in the lacuna, as established by the restoration of §1.

Actually, ka is still partially visible in the document, and a date near the end of Kaja (the second month), late March to early April, also fits the context of wheat-sowing.%§6 (Tib.) spa : sor : zhong : la : spo: “Pass to spāta Sudārrjāṃ”. Sor-zhong is the Tibetan rendering of Sudārrjāṃ.

See Takeuchi 1995, pp. 272-273, and Yoshida 2006, p.28. This Tibetan phrase naming the addressee of the order indicates that the order was issued by a Tibetan official. Other orders from Rmang bzher also contain a similar Tibetan phrase at the end. See Archive 3/1.34 §8 and Archive 3/1.42 §7.
