Zhìluó Liùchéng Zhōu 質邏六城州. See commentary on Archive 3/1.1 §5 (C).%§2 nvā salī: ‘according to the year’, indicating that the amount listed below was the tax in grain for an entire year, that is, 11 kūsas 9 ṣaṃgas per man.%§2 hvaṃḍä biśna 50 3: ‘53 men in total’. Compare the ‘53 men, (including both) the commissioned and the non-commissioned’ in Archive 3/6.3 §4, the 58 men in Archive 3/1.7 §4, and the 52 men ‘according to the register’ in Archive 3/6.7 §4. 4! 24%§3 ttāguttāṃ haudi śeṃgāṃ ṣaṃgna: ‘by the Tibetan seven-śeṃga ṣaṃga’. In the Tibetan system, one ṣaṃga equals to 7-śeṃga. Here, the issuer explicitly reminds the recipient of the Tibetan measurements, because Sudārrjāṃ confuses the Tibetan seven-śeṃga ṣaṃga with the Chinese 10-śeṃga ṣaṃga in his calculation of grain in Archive 3/1.7. See introduction to Archive 3/1.7.%§4 600 [30] [kūsa] 7 ṣaṃga: ‘630 kūsas 7 ṣaṃgas’. 11.9 kūsas per man × 53 men = 630.7 kūsas.%§6 [100 80] 4 kūsa ganaṃ: ‘184 kūsas of wheat’. 630.7 − 225.4 − 221.3 = 184.%§10 visarrjāṃ 50 2: ‘Visarrjāṃ, 52 (years old)’. The number after the name of a man indicated the age of the man, a common practice in registers. See Yoshida 2006, p.134.%§10 vīṃgulą̄ ña, ysāḍą̄ña: ‘From Vīṃgula’, ‘from Ysāḍa’. Vīṃgula and Ysāḍa are villages in Cira, only attested here.%§10 jīvvā khąṣṭarāṃ: ‘from Khaṣṭara among the Jīvas’, epithet of the name in the lacuna. Meaning unclear.%§12 [biśna-ṃ jsārä] himi: ‘[All their grain] is …’, restored according to biśna jsārä himi in §4.%§15 mattiśką̄ña, dumesalą̄ña, suhīkāña, bikiną̄ña: ‘From Mattiśka’, ‘from Dumesala’, ‘from Suhīka’, ‘from Bikina’. Mattiśka, Dumesala, Suhīka, and Bikina are villages in Birgaṃdara. Mattiśka is also in Archive 3/3.6 §14, Archive 3/5.3 §5, and Archive 3/5.22 §2. In Archive 3, Dumesala is only attested here, but it is in BH 5-1, a newly-discovered wooden document in Khotanese. See Duan 2015, p.146. Suhīka is also in Archive 3/4.6a §2, Archive 3/4.6p §2, Archive 3/5.3 §3, and Archive 3/5.22 §2. Bikina is also in Archive 3/1.23 §2.%§15 spą̄ñi: Place name, a village in Birgaṃdara, from spai- ‘to be rich, prosperous’, attested again in Archive 3/6.8 §5. It is also in the epithet of Si Vidyadatta from Phaṃnai in §18, referring 4! 25 a village of the same name in Phaṃnai. The expected form is spą̄ña, L.s., as in spāña sīlāṃ in §15.%§16 sūlyą̄ña: a village in Pa’, L.s., from sūlya- ‘Sogdian’. This village is only attested here in Archive 3.%§17 [āsk]u[ī]ra: ‘In Askūra’, parallel to ‘In Birgaṃdara’ in §15, ‘in Pa’’ in §16, and ‘In Phaṃnai’ in §18. A more common form is āskvīra, such as āskvīra śī’laṃ ‘Śī’laṃ from Āskūra’ in Archive 3/4.13d §2. Wen Xin (2008b, p.117, n.40) could not reconstruct this word and made a wrong conjecture.%§17 puñiśela: puñiśāla-, L.s., a village in Āskūra, attested again as puñaśālyā in Archive 3/3.11 §6.%§17 ba’sä vī: ‘upon ba’sa’. meaning unclear.%§18 kulą̄ña, buttaką̄ña: ‘From Kula’, ‘from Buttaka’.
