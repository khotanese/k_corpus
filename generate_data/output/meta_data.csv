Compare the ‘53 men (including both) the commissioned and the non-commissioned’ in Archive 3/6.3 §4 the 58 men in Archive 3/1.7 §4 and the 52 men ‘according to the register’ in Archive 3/6.7 §4.<br /><br />§3 ttāguttāṃ haudi śeṃgāṃ ṣaṃgna: ‘by the Tibetan seven-śeṃga ṣaṃga’. In the Tibetan system one ṣaṃga equals to 7-śeṃga. Here the issuer explicitly reminds the recipient of the Tibetan measurements because Sudārrjāṃ confuses the Tibetan seven-śeṃga ṣaṃga with the Chinese 10-śeṃga ṣaṃga in his calculation of grain in Archive 3/1.7. See introduction to Archive 3/1.7.<br /><br />§4 600 [30] [kūsa] 7 ṣaṃga: ‘630 kūsas 7 ṣaṃgas’. 11.9 kūsas per man × 53 men = 630.7 kūsas.<br /><br />§6 [100 80] 4 kūsa ganaṃ: ‘184 kūsas of wheat’. 630.7 − 225.4 − 221.3 = 184.<br /><br />§10 visarrjāṃ 50 2: ‘Visarrjāṃ 52 (years old)’. The number after the name of a man indicated the age of the man a common practice in registers. See Yoshida 2006 p.134.<br /><br />§10 vīṃgulą̄ ña ysāḍą̄ña: ‘From Vīṃgula’ ‘from Ysāḍa’.

Mattiśka Dumesala Suhīka and Bikina are villages in Birgaṃdara. Mattiśka is also in Archive 3/3.6 §14 Archive 3/5.3 §5 and Archive 3/5.22 §2. In Archive 3 Dumesala is only attested here but it is in BH 5-1 a newly-discovered wooden document in Khotanese. See Duan 2015 p.146. Suhīka is also in Archive 3/4.6a §2 Archive 3/4.6p §2 Archive 3/5.3 §3 and Archive 3/5.22 §2. Bikina is also in Archive 3/1.23 §2.<br /><br />§15 spą̄ñi: Place name a village in Birgaṃdara from spai- ‘to be rich prosperous’ attested again in Archive 3/6.8 §5. It is also in the epithet of Si Vidyadatta from Phaṃnai in §18 referring a village of the same name in Phaṃnai. The expected form is spą̄ña L.s. as in spāña sīlāṃ in §15.<br /><br />§16 sūlyą̄ña: a village in Pa’ L.s. from sūlya- ‘Sogdian’. This village is only attested here in Archive 3.<br /><br />§17 [āsk]u[ī]ra: ‘In Askūra’ parallel to ‘In Birgaṃdara’ in §15 ‘in Pa’’ in §16 and ‘In Phaṃnai’ in §18. A more common form is āskvīra such as āskvīra śī’laṃ ‘Śī’laṃ from Āskūra’ in Archive 3/4.13d §2. Wen Xin (2008b p.117 n.40) could not reconstruct this word and made a wrong conjecture.<br /><br />§17 puñiśela: puñiśāla- L.s. a village in Āskūra attested again as puñaśālyā in Archive 3/3.11 §6.<br /><br />§17 ba’sä vī: ‘upon ba’sa’. meaning unclear.<br /><br />§18 kulą̄ña buttaką̄ña: ‘From Kula’ ‘from Buttaka’.

The Gracious Lord refers to Viśa’ Vāhaṃ the King of Khotan. For more on him see introduction of Archive 3/1.41. It is also possible however that these 24 men were the sesame-sowers and wheat-sowers of the Gracious Lord mentioned in Archive 3/5.13 §12.<br /><br />§3 haubarai: honorific in Archive 3/4.5p §3 and in Archive 3/6.7 §8 together with āmāca.

This is why Sudārrjāṃ is asking Sāṃdara to make sure that the men arrive at the Fort at dawn or even before dawn.<br /><br />§10 dau[la pa’jsa byehīdä]: ‘they will [get heavy] sticks’ restored from context.

Au ~ ā alternation is common in the Khotanese language at this stage. For other instances see commentary on Archive 3/1.15 §12 Archive 3/1.24 §10 and Archive 3/2.11 §1. Skjærvø (Catalogue p.89) reads: ‘mau nai’ and takes mau for ‘wine’ and nai for na-ī but one would expect hā ‘to him’ rather than an enclitic pronoun.<br /><br />§3 paśā: ‘the commissioned’ also attested as paśāta- in Archive 3/1.23 §1 Archive 3/1.24 §8 Archive 3/5.2 §11 Archive 3/5.9 §2 Archive 3/5.14 §6 and Archive 3/6.7 §6. Vorob’ëva-Desjatovkaja (1996 p.174) renders this word as ‘servant’. Yoshida (2006 pp.120-122) translates it as ‘half-dependent’. The meaning of ‘the commissioned man servant’ fits the context here well. Makala used to be the commissioned man of Sudārrjāṃ and was thus exempt from the canteen duty. Naṃdaka now replaces Makala and becomes Sudārrjāṃ’s new commissioned man. As a result the canteen duty imposed on Naṃdaka should be transferred to Makala. As can be seen from the context paśā ‘the commissioned man’ is more like a job or task rather than a fixed social status.<br /><br />§7 spaśa{ña}ñāṣṭi: ‘to the patrols’. The first ña is deleted and the resulting form spaśañāṣṭi is what one expects.<br /><br />§7 gvāri yuḍe: ‘he made a complaint’. This legal term means ‘to bring a lawsuit against someone’.<br /><br />§8 pyaḍai: pyaḍa- ‘to reject turn down’ pf. 2s. As is made clear in §4 Naṃdaka has now replaced Makala to be the commissioned man. Consequently Naṃdaka’s patrol duty should be done by Makala. Naṃdaka made a complaint before Sāṃdara concerning the patrol duty but Sāṃdara rejected his request and put him on the canteen duty. Then Naṃdaka turned to Sudārrjuṃ for help. Sudārrjuṃ supported him and issued this order to transfer Naṃdaka’s canteen duty to Makala.<br /><br />§9 hatcaste: hatcy- hatcasta- ‘to be broken to be substituted’ pf. 3s. other forms are attested in Archive 3/1.25 §8 Archive 3/1.32 §14.

Also see Archive 3/1 II. Formula.<br /><br />§3-§4 [hīye paḍāṃda vā parau parstai hauḍa si ṣa]pāñara sameva: ‘[O Lord previously you have deigned to give us an order saying:] appoint canteen workers.’ The restoration is based on: 1) sameva impv. 2s must be in a quote from an order that Sāṃdara received from Sudārrjāṃ. 2) According to the restoration of line 1 there must be 14 akṣaras in the lacuna of line 2. 3) hīye ‘lord’ voc. is part of the formula of petitions to Sudārrjāṃ as attested in Archive 3/1.22 §3 and Archive 3/1.29 §3. 4) parstai hauḍa ‘you have deigned to give’. The honorific construction is used to show respect when addressing one’s superior especially in petitions see Archive 3/1.29 §3 and Archive 3/1.35 §5.<br /><br />§5 paśā avaśāna: ‘with the commissioned and the non-commissioned’. Usually the commissioned and the non-commissioned are treated differently in regard to tax corvée work and other duties. The phrase paśā avaśāna is used when the two groups are not differentiated. See Yoshida 2006 pp.120-122. Also see commentary on Archive 3/1.26 §3.<br /><br />§5 śe [hvaṃdye]: ‘everyone’. The phrase śe hvaṃdye is often used in conjunction with paśā avaśāna see Archive 3/1.14 §3 Archive 3/1.31 §5-§6 and Hedin 33 b1 (KT IV p.41).<br /><br />§6 spāta vīsa hīvī puñadatti: ‘spāta Vīsa’s Puñadatta’. Spāta Vīsa and Puñadatta are attested together again in Archive 3/2.8 a bilingual voucher. In the Chinese text of Archive 3/2.8 Puñadatta is clearly identified as a dependent presumably of spāta Vīsa.<br /><br />§7 bāysdai: ‘to observe to see to (something so that it is done) to check’ impv. 2s parallel with viśta ‘to place’ impv. 2s. in §6. This form is also attested in Archive 3/1.34 §6.<br /><br />§10 ttāguttā: ‘in Tibetan’. See commentary on ttāguttau in Archive 3/1.41 §7. For another instance of he alternation of au and ā see commentary on Archive 3/2.11 §1. This is the end of the quoted order in which Sudārrjāṃ demands Sāṃdara to send both the commissioned and the noncommissioned to do canteen duty in Cira and ignore the work assigned to the commissioned.<br /><br />§12 haysīru: hays- ‘to send’ opt. 2p.<br /><br />§14 haṣḍi yuḍi: ‘to make a petition’ pf. 3sg. This sentence is not the dating formula which should be at the end of the petition but a reference to a previous petition made by someone else perhaps Ṣanīra. Thus the date of the petition must fall between the date mentioned here (9/18) and the date of the order in response (9/21).<br /><br />§15 haṃdāḍa-y-[ū]: ‘reaped for you’. haṃdār- haṃdāḍa ‘to bring together to reap’. Skjærvø (Catalogue p.92) reads yu but the lower end of the akṣara is missing. The long tail of -ū the expected second person singular enclitic is probably in the lacuna. <br /><br />v:<br /><br />§3 thaiṣī: ‘Commissioner-in-chief’ referring to the military commander of the garrison stationed in the Fort of Phema corresponding to Chin. dàshǐ 大使 (Yoshida 2006 p.23 and 2008a p.468) Tib. the śi (Rong 1993 p.413) MMP ṯ’yšy (Yoshida 1994 p.371 not dàshī 大師 as he suggests there). This is one of the Chinese titles adopted by the Khotanese. Other such titles include Khot. phąna kvana ~ Chin. pànguān 判官 Khot. cāṃṣṣī ~ Chin. zhǎngshǐ 長史 and Khot. tsīṣī ~ Chin. cìshǐ 刺史. See commentary on Archive 3/1.1 §8 (C) and Archive 3/1.2 §2.<br /><br />§3 bulā(ni) rmąmi [śä’räna]: ‘Blon Rmang-[bzher]’ also attested in Archive 3/1.12 §11 Archive 3/1.22 §13 Archive 3/1.34 §1 Archive 3/1.42 §1 Archive 3/1.43 §1 (restored) and Archive 3/6.2 §1. As hinted by Skjærvø (Catalogue p.87) this Tibetan military officer is attested again in Or.15000/33 a Tibetan document from Mazar Tagh (Or.15000/33 = M.Tagh. 0512 see Takeuchi 1998 p.28 n.87 and TLTD II p.410). Yoshida (2006 pp.74-76 and 2008a pp. 468-469) identifies him with Lùn Mǎngrè 論莽熱 a Tibetan general captured by Tang forces in 802 in Nanzhao in present-day Yunnan but the latter was already active in Nanzhao in 794 (XTS v216b). A similar name blon Rma-bzher attested in a Tibetan document from Miran (TLTD II pp.413-14) shows that this name was fairly common at that time. Therefore Yoshida’s identification is probably incorrect. It can be inferred from Archive 3/1.34 §3 that blon Rmang-bzher was residing in Phema thus he was most likely the commander of the garrison at the Fort of Phema. He would not be the commander in charge of the entire Khotan region as suggested by Yoshida (2006 p.24) since the headquarters of the Tibetan administration in Khotan were located in the citadel at Shenshan present-day Mazar-Tagh as demonstrated by the numerous Tibetan documents discovered there. (Takeuchi 2004 p.55) Blon Rmang-bzher was certainly not the Military Commissioner (tcirrtū jiédù 節度) as suggested by Yoshida (2006 p.76) since the name of the Military Commissioner is attested in Archive 3/1.2 §3 as lųnä ha’bäśi’rä ‘Blon Lha bzher’.<br /><br />§3 vaña thaiṣī bulā(ni) rmąmi [śä’räna parau ā sä]: ‘Now [an order has come from] the Commissioner-in-chief blon Rmang-[bzher (saying)]’. Restored according to the formula of orders. See Archive 3/1 II. Formula.<br /><br />§4 miḍā jasti: ‘the Gracious Lord’ referring to the King of Khotan Viśa’ Vāhaṃ. For more on him see introduction of Archive 3/1.41.<br /><br />§4 māśa-vīrā: māśa-vīraa- ‘house-worker dependent’ from *māśa-kīraa- also attested in Archive 3/4.5p §3 Archive 3/4.5r §2 Archive 3/6.3 §5 and Archive 3/6.7 §5. According to Archive 3/6.7 §5 there are 15 ‘house-workers of the king’ in the 33rd regnal year. Wen Xin (2008a p. 125) first identified this term with Chin. jiārén 家人 ‘person of the household dependent’ attested in Archive 3/2.8 §2 (C) and multiple times as dependents of a Buddhist temple in Or. 8211/969-972 (MT.b.009) a long Chinese document dated to 721 CE. See Ikeda 1996 pp. 209-211.<br /><br />§4 paśā a[vaśāna]: See commentary Archive 3/1.24 §5.<br /><br />§4 viśtari: ‘to place’ impv. 2 pl. The quote of the Tibetan’s order ends here.<br /><br />§5 samevya[rä]: samev- ‘to agree on’ impv. 2pl. For the imperative ending -yarä see SGS p. 212-13.<br /><br />§6 būjāri: ‘to provide food (?)’ suggested by Bailey (Dict. p.295) not quite reliable.<br /><br />§8 hatcasta: hatcy- hatcasta- ‘to be broken to be replaced’ past participle nom.-acc. pl. not ‘*to cancel’ as Skjærvø (Studies III pp.159-162) suggests. This verb is also attested as hatcaste pf. 3s. in Archive 3/1.26 §9 and hatcyāre pres. mid. 3pl. in Archive 3/1.32 §14. Here one’s canteen duty can be replaced. Payments in silk cloth can be replaced by payments in small cloth or mūrās as in Archive 3/3.4 §8. One kind of grain can be replaced by another as in Archive 3/6.1 §.<br /><br />§8 [ni … ṣapā]ñara hatcasta: ‘The men on canteen duty [must not be] substituted.’ It can be inferred from the context that a negative is required here because the Tibetans have become angry (§7) and would not allow canteen duty to be substituted by other forms of labor or payments.,KT II: 20 (4); Catalogue: 92; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 186-192.

A similar formula is found in Archive 3/1.13 §2: ‘tsīṣī āstaṃna hamīḍa hārva u hamīḍa pa’kisina’.

Yoshida (2006 p.124) following Vorob’ëva- Desjatovskaya (1996 pp.174-175) suggests that stānaḍa refers to an official on the village level comparable to chaupaṃ. His argument however is based on a flawed interpretation of Hedin 18 (Archive 3/6.7). See commentary on Archive 3/6.7 §10. The meaning stānaḍa can also be demonstrated in Archive 3/1.41 §2: cira kṣvā auvā stānaḍāṃ vara u hamīḍa pa’kisanāṃ vara ‘to the superior teachers in Cira-Six Towns and all the commoners’ or ‘to the monks and the laymen’ including everyone in the prefecture.<br /><br />§8 [yuḍä yīṃdä]: yan- ‘to do’ pres. 3s. potential construction restored according to the context.<br /><br />§9 haṃdira prū: ‘the Inner Court’ also attested in a similar context in Archive 3/1.13 §7. Ttara ‘at your place’ shows the king was at haṃdira prū. It can be inferred that haṃdira prū does not refer to a fort as Skjærvø (Catalogue p.94) renders it but to the court or the palace where the King of Khotan resides. Wen Xin (2014 p.94) makes the same suggestion based on a Khotanese document on a wooden tablet.<br /><br />§9 lyiba’: ‘total’ Tib. lib uncertain See commentary on Archive 3/1.15 §19.<br /><br />§11 [ja]sti mu’śdi parī byaudi: ‘May the lord deign to find mercy’ a formulaic expression used in the petitions.

Skjærvø (Catalogue p. 98) reads: ‘d[rr]ai chā -i tsuna’. Here I follow Duan’s reading in Duan 2013a p.323 because it fits the figures well. According to Archive 3/3.4 §10 five men in Āskūra should deliver 3.2 × 5 = 16 feet of small cloth exactly the amount specified here in §7. If 3.2 feet of small cloth at the price of 450 mūrās per foot (Archive 3/3.4 §8) can replace 23 feet of floss silk cloth (Archive 3/3.2 §2) then the price of floss silk cloth is (450 × 3.2) ÷ 23 = 62. 61 ≈ 62.5 mūrās per foot or 62.5 × 40 = 2500 mūrās per bolt. Duan (2013a p.324) first makes this calculation and traces the fluctuation of cloth price in Khotan during the seventh to the ninth centuries. In Archive 3/3.4 §8 however the small cloth assigned to each man is increased from 3.2 feet to 3.65 feet. For an explanation of this increase see commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §8.<br /><br />§5 4suhena thau vāra paṃjsa chā: ‘Suhena owes five feet of cloth.’ Namaubuda delivered 36.2 feet of cloth on behalf of Suhena and Sūradatta (Archive 3/3.1 §22) so Suhena and Suradatta owe about 5 feet each. See commentary on Archive 3/3.1 §22.<br /><br />§6 sūradatti thau vāra paṃ[jsa chā …]: ‘Sūradatta owes five feet of cloth.’ Sūradatta later dilivered the cloth assigned to him see Archive 3/2.17 §2.<br /><br />§8 phaṃnājāṃ nva thaunakāṃ ha[tca 10 2 chā 8 tsuna]: ‘For those from Phaṃnai (the silk cloth is) replaced by [12.8] feet of small cloth.’ According to Archive 3/3.4 §8 the equivalent of 31.8 feet of small cloth is assigned to those from Phaṃnai and Pa’. 19 feet is assigned to those from Pa’ (§9) then 31.8 − 19 = 12.8 feet must be assigned to those from Phaṃnai. Since 3.2 feet is assigned to each (§3) there must be 4 men in Phaṃnai who should deliver small cloth. The restoration is based on Duan 2013a p.324. Also see commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §8.<br /><br />§9 [pa’ja nva] thaunakāṃ hatcaṃ nausä chā: ‘[For those from Pa’] (the silk cloth is) replaced by 19 feet of small cloth.’ According to Archive 3/3.4 §8 the equivalent of 31.8 feet of small cloth is assigned to those from Phaṃnai and Pa’. Since the small cloth assigned to those from Phaṃnai is recorded in §8 so the 19 feet of small cloth recorded here must be assigned to those from Pa’. 19 feet is 0.2 feet short of the amount assigned to 6 men (3.2 × 6 = 19.2). The restoration is based on Duan 2013a p.324. Also see commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §8.<br /><br />§10 saṃgi thau vāra 10 2 chā: ‘Saṃga owes 12 feet of cloth.’ It is recorded in Archive 3/3.7 §12 that Saṃga owes 20 feet of cloth.,KT II: 24 (4); Catalogue: 98; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 314-316.

The total amount of assigned cloth is 33 bolts 2 feet in Archive 3/3.2 §5 and Archive 3/3.4 §5 and implicitly so in Archive 3/3.3. (25 bolts 12 feet + 7 bolts 30 feet). It is unclear why the figure is different here.<br /><br />§3 mūri 40 4 ysā’cya ṣau ąni kuhi syini nāsą̄ñi: ‘Ṣau An Kuh-syin should receive 44000 mūrās.’ Note that ni is part of the name Ąni Kuhi-syini. This name is also attested in Archive 3/1.8 §1 spelt as ṣau ani kuki syini. The sum of 44000 mūrās can be linked with two payments one of 3000 mūrās (Archive 3/2.1) the other of 40000 mūrās (Archive 3/2.2 and Archive 3/3.1 §25). These two payments 43000 mūrās in total were made to ṣau An Sam. Both An Kuh-syin and An Sam are most likely Chinese names of Sogdians bearing the surname Ān 安 the surname assumed by Bukharan Sogdians. A similar name Ān Dáhàn 安達漢 is attested in Дх 18925 (Zhang and Rong 2002 p.230) a Chinese document from Dandan-Uiliq in the Russian Collection. For a discussion of the Sogdian names and their activities in Khotan see Rong 2009 p.406.<br /><br />§4 mista thauna haud[a u 30 chā tsīṣī u hārvā] 3u tsātā hvaṃḍāṃ bida himārä: ‘7 bolts [30 feet] of large cloth is (assigned) upon [the prefect the officials ] and the wealthy.’ The amounts assigned to the prefect six officials and three wealthy men are listed in §5-§14. The total is 3 × 40 + 40 + 20 + 20 + 15 + 15 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 310 feet = 7 bolts 30 feet exactly the amount restored here and also in Archive 3/3.2 §4 Archive 3/3.3 §4 and Archive 3/3.4 §4.<br /><br />§7 spāta burmaki 20 chā: ‘Spāta Burmaka (shall deliver) 20 feet.’ Spāta Burmaka is replaced by spāta Marṣa’ in Archive 3/3.7 §4. Spāta Burmaka is not attested elsewhere in Archive 3/3 nor in the vouchers in Archive 3/2. Spāta Marṣa on the other hand is recorded to have delivered the cloth assigned to him in Archive 3/2.9 §1 in Archive 3/3.1 §17.<br /><br />§16 mista [thauna himārä 20 5 u 10 2 chā]: ‘The large cloth (assigned to them) [is 25 bolts 12 feet]’ restored from Archive 3/3.2 §3: ‘tta nva hvaṃḍāṃ thauna himārä 20 5 u 10 2 chā’. This sentence is repeated in Archive 3/3.3 §3 and Archive 3/3.4 §3. 23 feet is assigned to each man (Archive 3/3.2 §2 Archive 3/3.3 §2 Archive 3/3.4 §2) so the total is 23 × 44 = 1012 feet = 25 bolts 12 feet. The total assigned amount should be 33 bolt 2 feet (Archive 3/3.2 §5 and Archive 3/3.4 §5) different from the figure in Archive 3/3.6 §1 32 bolts 11 feet which is probably a mistake since it doe not fit the number of workers and not repeated elsewhere.<br /><br />§19 [… haṃdira] prū: ‘the inner court’.

In Or.11252/34.1 Sudārrjaṃ issued the rosters of Patrol 17 to Patrol 19 but did not specified the date of Patrol 18 and Patrol 19. Instead he used ‘the second būka’ and ‘the third būka’ to refer to the team of Patrol 18 and Patrol 19 respectively. The first būka in Sudārrjaṃ’s mind must then be the team of Patrol 17. The three būkas refer to three teams on patrol duty on three different dates not three teams on the same day as Yoshida (2006 p.116) understands it. As shown in Table IV-13 in Chapter IV one team is made up of nine to 19 people. <br /><br />1-iii:<br /><br />§2 pa’ sudatti: ‘Sudatta from Pa’’.

See bāja- in Studies III pp.112-114.<br /><br />§2 śarkāṃ bāja vaśi’raki jsātä: ‘Vaśi’raka goes instead of Śarkāṃ’. The formula A bāja B jsātä ‘B goes instead ofA’ betrays the existence of a general patrol schedule and records a slight change of it before the patrol day. In contrast the formula A bāja B tsve ‘B went instead ofA’ records a change in the actual patrol and is used in retrospective rosters.<br /><br />§2 śarkāṃ bāja vaśi’raki jsātä [budadatti su]dattä: Restored from Archive 3/4.5r §2: ‘vaśi’raki || budadatti || āskvī(ra) sudatti’.<br /><br />§2 phāji cira: ‘Phāja from Cira’. Phāja did not go on patrol as his name is absent in Archive 3/4.5r.

According to the retrospective roster Vidyadatta Maṃgala and Kāśaka went on patrol as substitutes for Svarrnade Vasade and Sūrade. Therefore the name missing in the prospective roster between Svarrnade and Sūrade must be Vasade.<br /><br />§3 saṃgapuñi ||: According to Archive 3/4.5r Saṃgapuña did not go on duty in Patrol 5. He did not go on duty in Patrol 6 either as his name is present but deleted in Archive 3/4.6p and not in Archive 3/4.6r. He finally went on duty in Patrol 9 as in Archive 3/4.9p §2.<br /><br />§3 {vidarrjāṃ}: Vidarrjāṃ is deleted because Svarrnade is going on his behalf. See commentary on §4 below.<br /><br />§3 haubarai sīhai: ‘Haubarai Sīhai’. Haubarai is a rarely attested title. Apart from Sīhai only Ttirikvira bears this title as in Archive 3/5.20 §4 the only document where Sīhai is attested again. See commentary on Archive 3/5.20 §3.<br /><br />§3 salamai haubarai sīhai hīvī: ‘Salamai belonging to haubarai Sīhai’. Salamai as a dependent of Sīhai is of a lower social status. Salamai did not go on duty in Patrol 5 as his name is not in Archive 3/4.5r. He was rescheduled to attend the next patrol but this shift was canceled again since his name is present but deleted in Archive 3/4.6p and is not in Archive 3/4.6r.

This sentence accounts for the absence of Vidarrjāṃ in Archive 3/4.5r. It also explains the faint circle a mark of deletion around ‘vidarrjāṃ’ in §3. The handwriting of this sentence is different from the rest of the text but similar to the signum. The scribe listed both Svarrnade and Vidarrjāṃ earlier in the roster but Sudārrjāṃ when signing the document realized that Vidarrjāṃ would not go because Svarrnade was going on his behalf so he added this sentence after his signum and drew a circle around Vidarrjāṃ in the roster. <br /><br />b:<br /><br />§4 puṣa: ‘completely’.

The beginning of the order is missing but Sudārrjāṃ’s signum at the end indicates that he was the issuer.<br /><br />§3 pravanā: ‘registers’. See commentary on Archive 3/1.15 §24.<br /><br />§3 khu: ‘so that’. The actual instruction of the order is only one sentence long. The main clause should be in the imperative followed by an adverbial clause of purpose introduced by the conjunction khu. The length of the lacunae about nine to ten akṣaras long as determined by the restoration of §1 does not allow khu to introduce a conditional clause followed by a main clause as Skjærvø (Catalogue p.103) takes it.<br /><br />§6 kaśti: ‘to fall’ from kas- pres. 3s. <br /><br />v:<br /><br />§1 [@ thaiṣī bulāni rmąmi śi’]rä tta parī: ‘[The Commissioner-in-chief blon Rmang bzher] orders thus’ restored according to Archive 3/1.42 §1: ‘thai[ṣ]ī bulāni rmąmi śi’rä tta parī’. This restoration also establishes the original line length of the document thus providing clues for further restorations. Skjærvø’s restoration ‘[@ spāta ṣan]īrä’ (Catalogue p.103) is unlikely because the Tibetan phrase at the end requires a Tibetan issuer. For more on blon Rmang bzher see commentary on Archive 3/1.25 §3.<br /><br />§3 kharrjāṃ: Proper name also attested in Archive 3/4.6p §2 Archive 3/4.6r §2 and Archive 3/5.12 §10.<br /><br />§3 śera: ‘good’. The expected form is śärä. Perhaps the scribe had in mind śera ganama.<br /><br />§4 yau[varāyāṣṭi kharrjāṃ paśa]: ‘[Send Kharrjāṃ to the Young King]’. Not many words start with yau- so one is not left with many options when it comes to restoration. Skjærvø reconstructs ‘yau[dar- ? ……]’. (Catalogue p.103) My restoration however is based on the following: 1) Kharrjāṃ is attested in Archive 3/5.13 §10 as belonging to yauvarāya ‘the Young King’; 2) three ‘wheat-sowers’ are attested in Archive 3/5.20 §5 as belonging to the Young King; 3) an order must end with an imperative; 4) there must be eight akṣaras in the lacuna as established by the restoration of §1. For more on yauvarāya see commentary on Archive 3/6.7 §7.<br /><br />§5 kaji: ‘In the month of Kaja’. Skjærvø reads -ja and gives all month names that end in -ja: Rrāhaja Cvātaja and Kaja in the notes. Actually ka is still partially visible in the document and a date near the end of Kaja (the second month) late March to early April also fits the context of wheat-sowing.<br /><br />§6 (Tib.) spa : sor : zhong : la : spo: “Pass to spāta Sudārrjāṃ”. Sor-zhong is the Tibetan rendering of Sudārrjāṃ. Three alternative spellings are also attested namely bsar-gzhong (Hedin Tibetan 3 line 1) ksar-gzhong (Hedin Tibetan 3 line 3) sar-zhong (Hedin Tibetan 2 and M.- Tagh.a.ii. 0096). See Takeuchi 1995 pp. 272-273 and Yoshida 2006 p.28. This Tibetan phrase naming the addressee of the order indicates that the order was issued by a Tibetan official. Other orders from Rmang bzher also contain a similar Tibetan phrase at the end. See Archive 3/1.34 §8 and Archive 3/1.42 §7.

Here it probably refers to Administrative Assistant Fu Weijin who came down to the Six Towns to collect tribute cloth. See commentary on Archive 3/2.3 §2.<br /><br />§1 sūlīna: ‘the Sogdian’. The Sogdians functioned as creditors in Khotan. They lent money to residents who could not pay tax on time and charge a considerably high interest. See commentary on Archive 3/3.1 §34. Note that sūlīna here is in the singular. Who is this Sogdian?<br /><br />§2 thauna vā nāte dva tca’hausa-chāya: ‘He received two 40-foot-long bolts of cloth.’ For a parallel construction see Archive 3/3.10 §2: pe’mīnā thauna īdi dva bista-chāya ‘(he) has two pieces of 20-foot-long silk cloth’.<br /><br />§5 naraṃda: ‘to go out to convert (something) into money’. See commentary on Archive 3/3.1 §8.<br /><br />§6 [thauna]ka 50 3 tti sūlya nāṃdä haudyeṃ thaunāṃ va: ‘The Sogdians received 53 (pieces) of small cloth for seven bolts.’ In other words the Sogdians delivered 7 bolts of cloth to the officials on behalf of the workers who could not produce the cloth and received from the latter 53 pieces of small cloth in return. The 53 pieces of small cloth that the Sogdians received is mentioned in Archive 3/3.1 §33 but not the amount of cloth they delivered. The seven bolts that the Sogdian delivered is very close to the amount of cloth still outstanding (7 bolts 24.3 feet) calculated in Archive 3/3.4 §7 according to the delivered cloth before modification. According to the delivered cloth after modification 9 bolts 30.3 feet of cloth is outstanding. See commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §6. In Archive 3/3.4 a total of 50.1 feet of small cloth is assigned to the workers of the Six Towns. See commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §11. If one piece of small cloth is one foot long then the amount of small cloth that the Sogdians (53 feet) received is very close to the amount assigned (50.1 feet). Though the figures do not perfectly agree with one another the following is what I conceive as a plausible scenario. When the officials came down to the Six Towns to collect tribute cloth the Sogdian delivered the cloth still outstanding on behalf of the residents of the Six Towns and received small cloth from them in return making a handsome profit out of the deal. 53 feet of small cloth is worth 53 × 450 = 23850 mūrās. 9 bolts 30.3 feet of cloth is worth (9 × 40 + 30.3) × 62.5 = 24393.75 mūrās. The profit is 24393.75 − 23850 = 543.75 mūrās. For the price of small cloth see commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §8.

Pe’ is the gen.-dat. of pa’.<br /><br />§4 muttūṃ: meaning unclear. Bailey renders it as ‘bad’. Dict. p.335.<br /><br />§5 birgaṃdarajāṃ [paṃdāvā] biṃdä: ‘on [the roads] of Birgaṃdara’. Biṃ is still visible. paṃdāvā is restored from context.<br /><br />§6 haḍā: haḍaa- ‘guardian protecter’ G.D. pl. not hadā- ‘day’.<br /><br />§10 ha[ysa]: ‘send’ impv. 2s. The akṣara ‘ha’ though contaminated by the writings on the other side of the paper is still visible. This form is attested again in Archive 3/1.33 §5 another order concerning road work.<br /><br />§11 [ūtca]: ūtcā- ‘water’ N. f. restored according to narą̄maṃcä ‘to go out’ pres. part. f. N. and āṣaijä ‘pond’.<br /><br />§11 āṣaijä jä: āṣṣiṃyā- ‘pond’ G. f. s. The second jä is a dittography. This pond must be phąnāją̄ñä āṣaiṃji ‘the pond of Phaṃnai’ mentioned in Archive 3/1.36 §11.<br /><br />§11 hālai: ‘direction towards’. Dict. p.480.<br /><br />§11 narą̄maṃcä: naram- ‘to issue go out’ pres. part. N. f. This feminine participle must agree with a feminine noun in the lacuna a noun also related to the pond. Hence ūtca ‘water’ is restored.<br /><br />§12 bāra bāra gaysä parya näśāta: ‘Order to put loads and loads of reed’ similar to baśa’ baśa’ hā gaysä näśarä ‘Place loads and loads of reed there’ in Archive 3/1.33 §8.<br /><br />§14 stūra-pānä: ‘herdsmen of draft animals’. Dict. p.229.<br /><br />§14 hatcyāre: hatcy- ‘to be broken to be replaced’ pres. mid. 3p. also attested as hatcasta in Archive 3/1.25 §8 and hatcaste in Archive 3/1.26 §9. For its meaning of ‘to be replaced’ see commentary on Archive 3/3.4 §8. Skjærvø (Catalogue p.108) reads: ‘hamāre’. <br /><br />v-b:<br /><br />§1 thai[ṣ]ī bulāni rmąmi śi’rä: ‘The Commissioner-in-chief blon Rmang bzher’ the Tibetan military officer residing in the Fort in Phema. For more on him see Archive 3/1.25 §3.<br /><br />§2 kṣvā auvā [sp]ā[ta vidyada]ttä vara: ‘To [spāta Vidyada]tta in the Six Towns’. As part of the opening formula of the order this phrase gives the first recipient of the order an official from the Six Towns on the prefecture level. This official could be spāta Vidyadatta who together with pharṣa Sāṃdara was the recipient of an order from spāta Sudārrjāṃ in Archive 3/1.3. The number of akṣaras also matches the length of the lacuna see commentary on kū[si] in §4.<br /><br />§2 salya-bāyai pharṣa sāṃdari: ‘the Year-leader pharṣa Sāṃdara’. As Sāṃdara often received orders from spāta Sudārrjāṃ the prefect of the prefecture he must be an official on the township level. Here Sāṃdara was the recipient of an order issued to the prefecture because he was on duty to serve as the ‘Year-leader’ of the 33rd regnal year. For more on salya-bāyaa- see commentary on Archive 3/1.16 §2.<br /><br />§3 mara kītha: ‘here in the fort’. Kītha from kanthā- ‘city refers to Phema a fort or a fortified garrison where the Tibetan officer blon Rmang bzher resided. See commentary on phęmāña kīṃtha in Archive 3/1.1 §5 (K).<br /><br />§3 kūs[i] pa[sti pa]ttīyi: ‘he ordered to beat the drums’ restored according to kūsi pasti pharṣa vida kūsi pattīyi in §5. The drum was beaten to signal warnings of possible attacks. More on the drums see commentary on Archive 3/1.3 §11. On the length of the lacuna see commentary on kū[si] in §4.<br /><br />§4 sī: ‘suitable’ from sāj- sīta-/sīya-/sī ‘to learn’. Its secondary meaning of ‘to fit suit’ is widely attested in other Iranian languages including NP sāxtan sāz- Sogd. s’č- and so forth. See Dict. p.423.<br /><br />§4 cī ra kūsi pasti pharṣa vida kūsi pattīyi: ‘When he ordered pharṣa Vida to beat the drum’. The first kūsi is redundant.<br /><br />§4 kū[si]: ‘the drum’. In order to fully reconstruct the lacunae in a document one needs to first establish the original line length. It seems that the right end of the paper is fully preserved in line 5 as demonstrated by Archive 3/4.20r a patrol roster written on back of the this order where no akṣara is missing at the end of its line 3 corresponding to line 5 here. The original line length can thus be established. Consequently it becomes evident that there is only one akṣara missing after kū in line 3 and it must be si to give kūsi ‘the drum’.<br /><br />§4 paśi: paś- ‘to let go release send’ inf. see above<br /><br />§6 30 3 kṣuṇi: ‘the 33rd regnal year’ or year 799 CE when pharṣa sāṃdari was the Year-leader.<br /><br />§7 bir : ga : ’dru: ‘Birgaṃdara’ attested as be-rga-’dra in li-yul lung-bstan-pa (Prophecy of the Li Country). See Zhang and Rong 1983 p.82 and Emmerick 1967 p.72. Like other Tibetan phrases in Archive 3 this line of Tibetan indicates the location of the recipients of the order providing yet another piece of evidence pointing Birgaṃdara as the origin of Archive 3. <br /><br />v-c:<br /><br />§2 sūrade || śarkā: Both names are in Archive 3/4.5p §3.,KT II: 32 (5); Catalogue: 107; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 205-207 236-238 373-378.

The Crown Prince during Viśa’ Vāhaṃ’s reign was probably Viśa’ Kīrrta the King of Khotan in Archive 4 in IOL Khot 50/4 and IOL Khot 54/2. See Catalogue lxvii. As suggested by Yoshida (2006 p. 82) he could be identified with Bzhan-bzang Bzhan-la Brtan the last King of Khotan according to Li yul lung-btsan-pa. See Emmerick 1967 p.23 p.77. Outside Archive 3 this title is in Hedin 2 (KT IV p.22) and IOL Khot Wood 3 (Catalogue p.560) probably also referring to Viśa’ Kīrrta because these two document date from an earlier period of Viśa’ Vāhaṃ’s reign. The Young King in Or.12637/21.3a (Catalogue p.131) which is dated to the first year of the Young King and the year of ṣau Hviṃdū probably refers not to Viśa’ Vāhaṃ as Skjærvø (Catalogue p.lxvii) suggests but to a king who reigned in Khotan in the first half of the eighth century since a newlydiscovered wooden tally bears the date of the second year of ṣau Hviṃdū in Khotanese and the 15th year of the Kaiyuan era (726 CE) in Chinese.

Its price was at 62.5 mūrās per foot. See the calculation in commentary of Archive 3/3.9 §3.

Yąnivi is one of the spelling variants of Yąniviṭi attested in Archive 3/3.3 §10 Archive 3/3.7 §3.<br /><br />§9 puḍi: ‘to promise to commit oneself to owe’. See puḍa- in Studies III pp. 96-100. It is also attested in a newly discovered Chinese-Khotanese bilingual document corresponding to Chin. qiàn 欠 ‘to owe’. See Duan and Li 2014 p.31.<br /><br />§11 budarmä 20 3 chā: ‘Budarma (owes) 23 feet.’ Budarma delivered 23 feet of cloth in the third month of the next year as recorded in the voucher in Archive 3/2.17 §1.<br /><br />§12 hvīviṭi u visarrjāṃ kṣi chā: ‘Hvrrīviṭa and Visarrjāṃ (owe) 6 feet.’ Hvrrīviṭa and Visarrjāṃ are not attested in Archive 3/3.1 but it is recorded in Archive 3/2.15 §1 that ‘Visarrjāṃ from Cira together with Hvrrīva delivered 40 feet of cloth’. (Hvīviṭi and hvrrīvi are spelling variants of the same name.) Since one man was to deliver 23 feet of cloth Hvrrīviṭa and Visarrjāṃ should delivered 46 feet. They already delivered 40 feet and still owe 6 feet. As recorded in Archive 3/2.15 §1 Hvrrīviṭa and Visarrjāṃ’s payment of 40 feet was made on the 21st of the 12th month. Consequently this account must have been made after that date.<br /><br />§13 u thauna dva hālai va sūlya thaunaka nāṃdi: ‘The Sogdians took small cloth for 2.5 bolts.’ Bailey (KT IV p. 21) reads ‘u thauna dva hālai u’. As discussed in the commentary on Archive 3/3.1 §34 the Sogdians delivered tribute cloth on behalf of some people in return for small cloth. Here the emphasis is on the small cloth. The Sogdians delivered 2.5 bolts of tribute cloth for those who should but could not deliver it and took (nāṃdi) small cloth in return. The wording is slightly different in Archive 3/3.3 §6: thauna dva hālai sūlya hauḍāṃdi ‘the Sogdians delivered two and a half bolts’. The emphasis is on the tribute cloth. The Sogdians delivered (hauḍāṃdi) 2.5 bolts of tribute cloth to the officials on behalf of those who should but could not deliver it.<br /><br />§14 thini ttiki: This village name must be from Chinese. Bailey (KT IV p.60) suggests tiāndé 天 德 but a place name as such is not attested elsewhere in Khotanese and Chinese documents from Khotan.<br /><br />§14 biśa: bisā- L.s. ‘house village’ the lowest level in the administrative system of Khotan corresponding to Chin. cūn 村 ‘village’ (Duan 2009a p.66) but not Tib. tshan(d) as suggested in Tsugihito 2009 p.146. Tib. tshan(d) is equivalent to Chin. zhōu 州 ‘prefecture’ (Zhu 2012 p.75).<br /><br />§14 bisā: bisaa- particle following locatives.<br /><br />§15 kṣau na ra byaidi sūlau jsa: ‘The voucher has not been obtained from the Sogdians yet.’ The Sogdians should have received a voucher from spāta Śe’maka to whom they had delivered tribute cloth on behalf of some Khotanese workers. The Sogdians should then the pass the voucher to the officials of the prefecture so that their payment can be confirmed and taken into account but they have not done so. This lack of voucher is probably reflected again in Archive 3/3.16 §2.<br /><br />§16 mūrai ysāra kṣi-se ca’hau’si yaudarä hīye vāra: ‘Yaudara owes 1640 mūrās.’ One foot of small cloth is worth 450 mūrās (Archive 3/3.4 §8). 1640 mūrās is approximately equivalent to 3.65 feet of small cloth (3.65 × 450 = 1642.5) the amount assigned to those who deliver small cloth instead of floss silk cloth (Archive 3/3.4 §8-§9). Yaudara is attested again in Archive 3/3.12<br /><br />§3 as owing 520 mūrās.<br /><br />§17 mūri dvī ysā dvī-sa paṃjsāsi sūradatti hīye vāra: ‘Sūradatta owes 2250 mūrās.’ 2250 mūrās is equivalent to five feet of small cloth. (2250 ÷ 450 = 5) Interestingly it was recorded in Archive 3/3.9 §6 that Sūradatta owes 5 feet of cloth perhaps because Namaubuda delivered 18.1 feet on his behalf (Archive 3/3.1 §22) almost 5 feet short of the assigned amount. Additionally according to Archive 3/2.17 §2 Sūradatta paid his due in the third month of the next year. Conceivably the scribe of this document mistook the 5 feet of cloth that Sūradatta owed as 5 feet of small cloth.<br /><br />§18 mūrä ysārä kṣi-si cahausi pa’ sudatti vāra: ‘Sudatta from Pa’ owes 1640 mūrās.’ As in<br /><br />§16 1640 mūrās is the amount assigned in Archive 3/3.4 §9. Sudatta from Pa’ is not attested in the vouchers. Perhaps he also repaid his debt three months later but his voucher has not been preserved.,KT IV: 21 53-61; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 290-294.

Hedin (KT IV p.22) reconstructs: ‘vaña’.<br /><br />§4 ha[jsema]: hajsem- ‘to send’ impv. 2s. Since this sentence is a quote of a previous order it requires an imperative.

The word is abundantly attested in Archive 2 and its meaning of ‘to borrow’ is best illustrated in SI P 103.22 line 2: pātci karūsai thaunakä jistä śau paśa heḍä 2 ‘Next Karūsai borrowed one piece of small cloth. He will deliver two pieces in the autumn’. (SDTV III p.144. The translation is my own.) Another illustrative example comes from Or.6397/2 line 2-3 (Catalogue p.9): tti buru [x] mūri jistādä ‘the following borrowed money’. This is followed by seven parallel phrases each stating one man owes 125 mūrās. Take the first as an example: hatkaṃ mūri puḍä sa sparibistä ‘Hatkam owes 125’.<br /><br />§10 gvaścāṃda: gvaśc- ‘to pay’ pf. 2pl.<br /><br />§11 akalāści: ‘unskillful incompetent’ Nom.-acc. sg.

In the Khotanese language at this stage āṃ and uṃ often alternate just as Sudārrjuṃ partly from Arjuna is often spelt Sudārrjāṃ.

Bailey (KT IV p.22) reconstructs: ‘[draṃ]mā’.<br /><br />§24 pravanāja: ‘of the register’ from pravanaa- ‘register’ in which the names and ages of the residents of an administrative unit be it a township or a village are recorded. For its etymology see KT IV p.70. Yoshida (2006 pp.133-134) collects seven such registers: including two Chinese ones four Khotanese ones and a Chinese-Khotanese bilingual one. Oguchi 2007a supplemented by Oguchi 2007b is a detailed study of Ch 3473 T IV Chotan one of the registers in Chinese. For a newly-discovered Chinese-Khotanese bilingual register see Duan Qing 2009a.<br /><br />§24 pīśini: unclear. Bailey (KT IV p.22) reads: ‘biśi’.<br /><br />§26 hārū-ṃ: ‘my officials’.

Compare Archive 3/6.10 §1: spāta sudārrjā haṃdira prū vagevidina mūri jisti 20 2 ysā’ca sa bisti ‘Spāta Sudārrjāṃ borrowed 22 120 mūrās from Vagevida in the Inner Court’. Bailey (KT IV p.22) reads: ‘[.] mūri vageve dina jiste’. <br /><br />v:<br /><br />§1 [bi]rgaṃdara pharṣa sāṃdari: ‘Pharṣa Sāṃdara in Birgaṃdara’. This is an unequivocal evidence showing that pharṣa Sāṃdara was in Birgaṃdara. In other words the entire Archive 3 originated from Birgaṃdara. <br /><br />v (from the other end of the page):<br /><br />§2 kṣvā au[vā sudārrjāṃ]: ‘Sudārrjāṃ in the Six Towns’. The length of the lacuna is established by [@ spāta su]dārrjāṃ tta parī in Archive 3/1.15 §1 written on the back of this document. Bailey (KT IV p.23) constructs: ‘kṣvā au[vā spāta]’.<br /><br />§2 hārva: hārua- G.-D. pl. ‘officials’. This word must refer to the second group of men in the list spātas and pharṣas in other words the officials. In OKh. the word means “merchant” (Bailey 1949 p.124; KT IV p.54; Dict. p.479.) translating Skt. śreṣṭhin which in turn is translated into Chin. shāngzhǔ 商主 and Tib. tsong dpon in Buddhist texts both meaning ‘chief of mer- chants’. Skt. śreṣṭhin however literally means ‘having the best chief a person of rank or authority’. Only in certain contexts say some Buddhist texts it can also mean ‘chief of merchants’ specifically. Its meaning of ‘official’ is most clearly shown in Archive 3/1.13 §2 where the prefect is identified as a hārua and all the hāruas are contrasted with pa’kisina Chin. bǎixìng 百姓 ‘commoner’: tsīṣī āstaṃna hamīḍa hārva u hamīḍa pa’kisina ‘all the officials headed by the prefect and all the commoners’ in other words everybody in the prefecture.<br /><br />§2 tsīṣī āstaṃna hamīḍa hārva u hamīḍa pa’kisina: ‘all the officials headed tsīṣī and all the commoners’. The opening formula of this petition is somewhat strange. Compare the standard opening formula in Archive 3/1.21 §2: ‘kṣvā auvā tsīṣī spāta sudārrjāṃ u kṣā auvā bisā hārva u hamīḍa pa’kisina’.<br /><br />§3 hatcast-e piṣkali: ‘partitioned section’. hatcañ- hatcasta- ‘to break’. Bailey (KT IV p.23) reads: ‘hacasta’. A similar construction hatcastū piṣkali is attested in §12. This may be the official term for ‘prefecture’ in Khotanese. For piṣkala- ‘prefecture’ see Archive 3/1.1 §5 (K). For the meaning of hatcasta piṣkala see Yoshida 2008b p.118 n.44.<br /><br />§3 piṣkali vī jva himāmaṃ ttaṃdī jasti puñau jsa: ‘we are living in the prefecture by so much merits of the Lord.’ The same formula is attested in Archive 3/1.21 §3.<br /><br />§4 biśi [bāḍä]: ‘in all lands’. Restored from biśi bā[ḍa] in Archive 3/1.21 §4.<br /><br />§4 [pajsa]ma yanīda: ‘to worship to honor’. Restored according to the context.<br /><br />§6 kamalaja: ‘poll tax’ from kamala- ‘head’. kamalaja mūra ‘poll-tax in money’ is attested in documents from Archive 2. See Yoshida 2006 p.102.<br /><br />§6 sa ha[x x x x] kūsa ṣau: unclear.<br /><br />§7 haṃdira prū: ‘the Inner Court’ where the King of Khotan resided. See commentary on Archive 3/1.21 §9.<br /><br />§8 dāśādūṃ: dāś- ‘to finish’ (+inf.) pf. 1pl.<br /><br />§8 paphūjāṃ: paphūj- ‘to collect’ inf. -āṃ < -ānä parallel to märāṃ from mar- ‘to die’ inf. in Archive 3/1.39 §16.<br /><br />§11 karairā: ‘ploughing (?)’ attested as karera in Archive 3/5.16 §1.<br /><br />§13 dikh[autta]: ‘miserable’. Such a reading leaves hiyau before it unaccounted for.<br /><br />§14 vañauṃ vī [ja]sti mu’śdi [parī] byaudi: ‘Now may the Lord deign to have mercy upon us.’ Restored according to Archive 3/1.21 §11: ‘[ja]sti mu’śdi parī byaudi’. A formulaic expression used in petitions. See Archive 3/1 II. Formula.<br /><br />§15 śāraṇ[ä]: ‘service’.<br /><br />§16 tsāṣṭa: ‘calm at ease’.,KT IV: 22 67-71; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 149-152 158-163.

See commentary on Archive 3/4.4r §2. <br /><br />a-ii:<br /><br />§1 tsīdä: ’they are going’ This must be a scribal error for tsvādi ‘they went’ when the scribe copied it from the prospective roster. A similar error appears in Archive 3/4.7r §1 and Archive 3/4.16r §1. Also see Archive 3/4 I. Introduction.<br /><br />§2 suhada[tti phaṃnāji ||] ṣanīraki: Restored from the corresponding prospective roster in Archive 3/4.2p §2: ‘phaṃnāji sahadatti || ṣanīraki’.<br /><br />§2 ∩: Shorthand form of the name separator ‘||’.<br /><br />§2 sa[loki ∩ maṃñe ∩ sarkāṃ ∩] īrvadatti: Restored from the corresponding prospective roster in Archive 3/4.2p §2: ‘saloki ∩ maṃñe ∩ sarkāṃ ∩ {hunaki} ∩ {makali} ∩ ’īrvadatti’. <br /><br />b-i:<br /><br />§2 vidyadatt[i ∩] maṃgali [∩]: The restoration of ‘buda[rmä]’ in Archive 3/4.4r §2 determines that only one akṣara is missing at the end of line 6 and line 7 and the missing akṣara after ‘vidyadatti’ and ‘maṃgali’ must be ‘∩’. Actually part of ‘∩’ after ‘maṃgali’ is still visible. <br /><br />b-ii:<br /><br />§2 aką̄nadatti || buda[rmä ||] sīlāṃ || kharajsajsi ||: Restored by comparison with Archive 3/4.4p §4: ‘aką̄nadatti || budarmä || pramuhā vasade kharajsajsi’. Here ‘sīlāṃ’ replaces ‘pramuhā vasade’. This restoration establishes the length of the lacuna at the right end of the document.<br /><br />§2 śirguli suhadatta [suha]dāysi || virgāṃ: Restored by comparison with Archive 3/4.4p §4: ‘suhadatti suhadāysi {suhena} virgā’. ‘Suhadatti’ is mentioned without the epithet in the prospective roster.<br /><br />§2 śirguli: Place name a village in Birgaṃdara attested as Suhadatta’s place of origin in Archive 3/4.17r Archive 3/5.9 §2 and Archive 3/5.17 §2. Wen Xin (2008a p.120 n.56) points out that this village is also in Or.12637/21.3a (Catalogue p.131) a document in the Harding Collection that records the names and ages of grain deliverers in Birgaṃdara. This attestation clearly demonstrates that Śirgula was a village in Birgaṃdara.<br /><br />§2 ṣanīri ∩ {puñadatti}: these two names are not in Archive 3/4.4p. <br /><br />b-iii:<br /><br />§2 āskvī(ra) sudatti: ‘Sudatta in Āskūra’. Āskūra is one of the Six Towns.<br /><br />§2 |[| budāṣṭirä ||] kalidrri: Restored from Archive 3/4.5p §2: ‘budāṣṭirä || kaledrä’.<br /><br />§2 svarrnadi bāja vidyadatti tsve: ‘Vidyadatta went instead ofSvarrnada’. The formula A bāja B tsve means B in the retrospective roster went on duty instead ofA in the prospective roster.<br /><br />§2 {maṃgali}: Maṃgala went on patrol as a substitute. The scribe wanted to include the man replaced by Maṃgala so he deleted Maṃgala and wrote ‘vasadi bāja maṃgali tsve’ at the end of the roster to show that Maṃgala went on duty instead of Vasade.<br /><br />§2 bu[ttaṃdai ||] suhadāysi \māśa-vīrai/: Restored from Archive 3/4.5p §3: ‘buttaṃdai māśavīrai [suhadā]ysä māśa-vīrai ||’. One ‘māśa-vīrai’ is omitted here. ‘[Suhadā]ysä’ in Archive 3/4.5p is restored according to ‘suhadāysi \māśa-vīrai/ || nahvąni’ here. <br /><br />b-iv:<br /><br />§2 gūma sūradi: ‘Sūrada in Gūma’. Gūma is a village in Āskūra. See commentary on Archive 3/5.22 §2.<br /><br />§2 gūma sūradi || [sāmadatti ||] saṃganaṃdi bāja yaduysi ||: Restored from Archive 3/4.6p §2: ‘sūrade || sāmadatti ||saṃganaṃdi’.<br /><br />§2 kharamurrai va vā tsve: ‘Kharamurrai went here.’ In other words Kharamurrai did not go on patrol as previously scheduled. The formula va vā tsve corresponds to the formula va vāri spaśaña śau jūṃ in the prospective roster.<br /><br />§2 īrvadatti [va vā tsve || ] śirībudi ||: restored from Archive 3/4.6p §2: ‘īrvadatti va vārä spaśaña śau jūṃ || śirībudi ||’.<br /><br />§2 kharrjāṃ: ‘Kharrjāṃ’ is the first undeleted name in Archive 3/4.6p. The two names preceding it and the two following it are all deleted. The scribe of this roster seemed to have overlooked ‘Kharrjāṃ’ first and later added it to the end. He is also in Archive 3/1.42 §3 as a competent wheat-sower. <br /><br />c:<br /><br />§1 tsīdi: ‘they go’. Again the past tense tsvādi is expected. See commentary on Archive 3/4.2r.<br /><br />§2 [sudarmä || ] puñadi: Restored from Archive 3/4.7p §2: ‘sudarmä || puñadi’.<br /><br />§2 [jsajsaki || hu]naki || burmaki: Restored from Archive 3/4.7p §2: ‘jsajsaki | hunaki || burmaki ||’. <br /><br />d:<br /><br />§1 gayseta sudatti: ‘Sudatta from Gaysāta’. Gaysāta corresponding to Chin. jiéxiè 傑謝 one of the Six Towns is identified with present-day Dandan-Uiliq some 120 km north of Keriya. See Zhang and Rong 1987 p.80. Gaysāta must have already been abandoned shortly after the Tibetans took control of Khotan in the late 790s. See Stein 1907 p.284. In all the attestations of this town in Archive 3 including gayseta sudatti here vidyadatti gaysātaji in Archive 3/4.10p §2 and gaysāyī vidyadatti in Archive 3/5.5 §6 Gasyāta only indicates the origin of Sudatta and Vidyadatta but does not refer to the actual town.<br /><br />§2 uysbāki budadatti: ‘Budadatta son of Uysbāka’. This is a rare way of identifying people in Archive 3.<br /><br />§2 hīśī’nai: unclear.,KT IV: 24-25 79-82; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 334 336 338 340-341 344-345 349-352.

Pu’sūṃ is attested in Archive 3/1.40 §1. Complete formulae are attested in SI P 103.35 and SI P 136.1r. (SDTV III p.149 and p.160)<br /><br />§2 ttarau: from ttara-ū. Ttara ‘there with you’ is the medial or second person spatial deixis contrasted with mara ‘here with me’ and vara ‘there with them’. Not recognized as such by Bailey (KT IV p.92) but by Skjærvø (personal communication).<br /><br />§4 gyidä: gän- ‘to buy’ pres. 3s. Bailey reads gyedä (KT IV p.26) and takes it (KT IV pp.93-93) as a defective spelling for pres. 2p. but recognizes this form as pres. 3s. in Dict. p.83. Because of paḍāṃda ‘formerly’ a perfect is expected here either girye pf. 3s or even giryāṃda pf. 2p. Could it be a scribal error?<br /><br />§5 auyau: auya- ‘townsman resident in the town’ I.-Ab. pl. Not recognized as such by Bailey (KT IV p.92).<br /><br />§6 pīḍakä: ‘document’. This term indicates that the sender and the recipients were of equal or comparable social status. Otherwise parau ‘order’ or haṣḍa ‘petition’ would be used.<br /><br />§6 Signum-JUN: The signum resembles the Chinese Character jùn 俊. Yoshida (2004 p.31) notices that this signum is also attested at the end of IOL Tib N 2220 a fragmentary wooden tally from Balawaste obtained by Stein during his 3rd Expedition (Catalogue p.574) and links it with Zhào Jùn 趙俊 the name of a scribe (Diǎn 典) in Or.8212/702 (Balawaste 0160 see Maspéro 1953 p.186) a Chinese-Khotanese bilingual document also from Balawaste. By the way the Khotanese text in Or.8212/702 has not been published yet. The attestations of the same Signum both in Archive 3 and documents from Balawaste lend strong support to the identification of Birgaṃdara with the site of Balawaste. <br /><br />v:<br /><br />§2 śūṃdasi: ‘eleven’. There are 12 names in §1 but Sāṃdara is attested twice.<br /><br />§2 gīra: loc. sg. of gara- ‘mountain’ referring to the Tibetan headquarters in the citadel at the site of Mazar Tagh.

Signum-SU,a:<br /><br />§2 [a ksā’ auvā bisai] mulaki: ‘I (am) Mulaka (a resident of the Six Towns).’ The right end of the document is damaged and an unknown number of akṣaras are missing. Bailey (KT IV p.27) assumed that only two akṣaras are missing in the first line and supplied aysä in the lacuna. It is more likely however that more akṣaras are missing since one would expect the petitioner to reveal himself with a title such as a pharṣa sāṃdari ‘I (am) pharṣa Sāṃdara’ in Archive 3/1.24 §2 or aysä kṣā’ auvā bisai ysevidṭä ‘I (am) Ysevidṭa a resident of the Six Towns’ in Archive 3/1.19 §2.

Note that in Archive 3/6.8 §2 Darauka bears the title auva-haṃdasta.<br /><br />§2 kāṃha thaunaka: ‘hemp small cloth’. This must be different from the unmarked thaunaka ‘small cloth’ as is evident in §3 where the amounts of both small hemp cloth and small cloth are given.<br /><br />§2 auva-haṃdasti: The title of an official on the township level lower than spāta perhaps corresponding to Chin. xiāngtóu 鄉頭. See Wen Xin 2008a pp. 138-39. This title is attested in a newly discovered Chinese document from Khotan. Wen Xin (2008a pp.138-139) first reported on it and read the related phrase as Jiéxiè Xiāngtóu Mòlǐwéi (or yào) suō 傑謝鄉頭沒里惟(or 曜) 思. Zhang Mingxin and Chen Hao (2010 pp.2-4) then published the document but parsed this phrase differently and interpreted it incorrectly. Actually this name is also attested in a newly discovered Chinese-Khotanese bilingual document GXW 0107 as Chin. Mòlǐyàosuō 沒里曜娑 Khot. Brīyasa. (Duan and Li 2014 p.30) This phrase should read Jiéxiè Xiāngtóu Mòlǐyàosuō 傑 謝鄉頭沒里曜思 ‘Brīyasa auva-haṃdasta of Gaysāta’.<br /><br />§2 ysiviṭi: Proper name often attested in Archive 3 but spelled variously as Yseviḍa Ysevidṭa Yseviḍta Yseviṭa or Ysiviḍta. Note that he identifies himself as kṣā’ auvā bisai ‘a resident of the Six Towns’ in Archive 3/1.19 §2.<br /><br />§3 ysāḍadatti: Proper name attested in Archive 3/1.33 §12 as the auva-haṃdasta of Āskūra. In other words the three men in this document namely Darauka from Birgaṃdara Yseviṭi from Phaṃnā and Ysāḍadatta from Āskūra were all auva-haṃdastas.<br /><br />§3 3 20sta-chāya: ‘of 23 feet’.

Bailey (KT IV p.28) reads: ‘bhaśadatti’. Āśnadatta is not attested in Archive 3/3.6 nor in the vouchers nor in other accounts in Archive 3/3. He is however attested in Archive 3/5.5 §1 Archive 3/6.2 §10 Archive 3/6.5 §2 and Archive 3/6.22 §1.,KT IV: 28 102-103; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 310-311 317-319.

The delivered cloth must be 1322 − 304.3 = 1017.7 feet or 25 bolt 17.7 feet the original figure in the document. This figure is later corrected to 23 bolt 11.7 feet or 931.7 feet 2 bolts 6 feet less than the original figure. The amount of delivered cloth in Archive 3/3.2 §6 (23 bolts 11 feet) and Archive 3/3.3 §5 (23 bolts [11.7] feet) agree with the corrected figure here. The correction was made with denser ink similar to the ink used in §8-§12. According to the corrected figure 390.3 feet of 9 bolts 30.3 feet of cloth is still outstanding. Perhaps the scribe decided not to take into consideration of the 2.5 bolts the Sogdians delivered (Archive 3/3.2 §13 and Archive 3/3.3 §6) because the voucher of this payment has not been obtained (Archive 3/3.2 §15 and Archive 3/3.3 §7). But 2.5 bolts is 14 feet more than 2 bolts 6 feet. At present this discrepancy has to remain unaccounted for.<br /><br />§8 hatcaṃ: ‘conversion replacement’ from hatcañ- ‘to break’. Tribute cloth can be replaced by small cloth or money. See commentary on Archive 3/1.25 §8.<br /><br />§8 śe hvaṃḍyi hatcaṃ 3 chā kṣi tsuna hālai tca’hause paṃjsāsī chā: ‘For each man the replacement of (cloth by small cloth) (the amount of small cloth) is 3.65 feet (at the price of) 450 mūrās per foot.’ Since one foot of small cloth is worth 450 mūrās 3.65 feet of small cloth is equivalent to 1642.5 mūrās approximately 1640 mūrās the amount assigned to one man in §9 also the amount owed by Yaudara (Archive 3/3.2 §16 and Archive 3/3.3 §15) and Sudatta from Pa’ (Archive 3/3.2 §18 and Archive 3/3.3 §17). In Archive 3/3.9 §3 however 3.2 feet of the small cloth is assigned to each man who substitutes small cloth for cloth. The increase from 3.2 feet to 3.65 feet is probably due to the increase of the amount of cloth still outstanding from 304.3 feet to 390.3 feet (Archive 3/3.4 §6). But the figures do not perfectly agree with each other.<br /><br />§10 āskvīra paṃji hvaṃḍā thaunakā nva mūri himārä 8 ysārä dvī-sa 10 8 chā drai tsuna thau va: ‘For the five men in Āskūra (the sum) is 8200 mūrās for 18.3 feet of small cloth.’ 1640 × 5= 8200. 3.65 × 5 = 18.25 ≈ 18.3. In Archive 3/3.9 §7 the amount of small cloth for those in Āskūra is 3.2 × 5 = 16 feet.<br /><br />§11 phąnājā u pa’jā daśvi: Bailey (KT IV p.29) reads: ‘phąnājā u pa’jā paṃjyi’. Bailey’s reading does not agree with the manuscript nor the context since there should be ten men in Phaṃnai and Pa’ combined see below.<br /><br />§11 phąnājā u pa’jā daśvi thaunakā mūri himārä 10 4 ysā’ca drrai-se 10: ‘For the 10 (men) from Phaṃnai and Pa’ (the sum) for small cloth is 14310 mūrās.’ 14310 mūrās is equivalent to 31.8 feet of small cloth. It seems that the amount assigned to those from Phaṃnai and Pa’ is not 3.65 feet per man but 3.2 feet per man same as the amount in Archive 3/3.9 §3. In Archive 3/3.9 §9 19 feet is assigned to those from Pa’ approximately the amount for six men (3.2 × 6 = 19.2) while the amount assigned to those from Phaṃnai is missing in Archive 3/3.9 §8. If we assume that the total amount of small cloth assigned to people from Phaṃnai and Pa’ in Archive 3/3.9 is also 31.8 feet then the amount of small cloth assigned to those from Phaṃnai in Archive 3/3.9 §8 should be 31.8 − 19 = 12.8 feet the exact amount assigned to four men (12.8 ÷ 3.2 = 4). In other words there are 15 men five from Āskūra four from Phaṃnai and six from Pa’ who deliver small cloth instead of floss silk cloth. The above calculations are based on and improved from Duan 2013a pp.323-24. Also note that the total amount of small cloth assigned here is 31.8 + 18.3 = 50.1 feet close to the 53 pieces of small cloth that the Sogdians received (Archive 3/3.1 §33 and Archive 3/3.8 §6). <br /><br />b:<br /><br />§6 thau 20 chā sakāṃ hīvī vāra: ‘Sarkāṃ owes 20 feet of cloth’. Sakāṃ is a scribal error for sarkāṃ a well attested name in Archive 3. It is hard to explain however why Sarkāṃ is not attested in the payment account in Archive 3/3.1 nor in the debtor list in Archive 3/3.2 and Archive 3/3.3 nor in the vouchers in Archive 3/2.,KT IV: 29 104-106; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 299-303.

Voucher.,a:<br /><br />§2 cirāṃ naṃdakä: ‘Naṃdaka from Cira.’ According to Archive 3/2.5 Naṃdaka paid 46 feet of cloth on the 27th of the 11th month. He is also as Sudārrjāṃ’s ‘commissioned’? (paśā) in Archive 3/1.26 §4.<br /><br />§2 ṣṣau ąni sąmi: ‘ṣṣau An Sam’. It was into this man’s treasury that Naṃdaka delivered the mūrās. He was also the issuer of the next voucher (Archive 3/2.2). This name is certainly not Khotanese and ąni reminds one of Chin. Ān 安 the Chinese surname assumed by Bukharan Sogdian immigrants in China. Also see commentary on Archive 3/3.6 §3.<br /><br />§2 pājiña: ‘in the treasury’ see KT IV p.108 also attested in Archive 3/3.1 §25.<br /><br />§2: ysārī haṃbā: ‘by the amount of 1000’ or ‘(string) of 1000 (coins)’. This phrase translates Chin. guàn 贯 ‘a string of 1000 coins’ corresponding to Sog. ptkwk and JP ptkw. Strings of coins were easier to use since merchants in Khotan be they Sogdians or Persian Jews often handled large amount of money from several thousand up to a hundred thousand coins. See Bi and Sims-Williams 2010 pp. 505-06.<br /><br />§4 hārū: hārua- ‘official’. commentary on Archive 3/1.13 §2.<br /><br />§4 hārū raṣade: ‘Raṣade the official’.

See Sha and Wood 2005 v.2 p.313.<br /><br />§2 Gaudä: Proper name also attested in Archive 3/4.11r §2 Archive 3/4.14p §2.<br /><br />§3 Signum-An Sam: The signum resembles the Chinese character xìn 信. Ṣau Śattuṃ’s signum as attested in SI P 94.2 [SD 7 Plate 70 (b)] SI P 103.38 [SD 7 Plate 120 (b)] and Or.6405 (M.9) (Hoernle 1901 Plate 3; Sha and Wood 2005 v.2 p.331) in Archive 2 is also similar to xìn 信 but is markedly different from An Sam’s signum. <br /><br />c:<br /><br />§1 娑捺 Suōnà: transcribe Chin everywhere (the first time) ‘Suhadatta’. Nà 捺 Sui-Tang Chang’an Chinese nda (Coblin 1994 p.307). During the eighth to the tenth century nasals in Northwest Chinese changed into pre-nasalized voiced stops and then plain voiced stops. Amoghavajra systematically used Chinese characters with nasal initials and non-nasal finals to transcribe voiced stops in Sanskrit. (Maspéro 1920 p.29) This character nà 捺 is also attested as the phonetic transcription of da in Pénnà 盆捺 for Puñadatta in Archive 3/2.8 §1 and in Sūlǐnà 蘇里捺 for Suradatta in Archive 3/2.17 §1. G. Haloun reads 捈 tú in KT IV p.173 p.175. Bailey adopts R. Kaneko’s same reading in SDTV p.123. Rong (2012 p.25) reads 捺.<br /><br />§1 進奉 jìnfèng: ‘Tribute’. For a general discussion of tribute during the second half of the Tang Dynasty see Li Jinxiu 2001 pp.969-1019. Zhang and Rong (1997 pp.349-350) suggest that this tribute collected in Khotan was to be delivered to the Tibetan Btsanpo. Based on this understanding Yoshida (2006 p.59) links this tribute with Tibetan military activities against the Kingdom of Nanzhao in present-day Yunnan in Southwest China. Due to the long distance between Khotan and Tibet however the tribute might not have been actually delivered to the Tibetan court it might have been stored separately as the Btsanpo’s private property. For a similar practice in Dunhuang during the Tang Dynasty see Li Jinxiu 2001 p.982.<br /><br />§1 絁紬 shīchōu: ‘Floss silk cloth’ corresponding to Khot. thau and probably Tib. men dri. Shīchōu 絁紬 is a special textile produced in Khotan mentioned by Xuanzang. (Xiyuji p.1001) Duan and Wang (2009 pp.308-309) suggest that this kind of silk was different in that the silk makers allowed the silkworms to transform into moths and come out of the cocoons and spun silk from the broken cocoons.<br /><br />§1 tcinaji: ‘of tribute’ the adjective form of tcina which in turn comes from Chin. jìn 進 LMC tsin (Pulleyblank p.157) for jìnfèng 進奉 ‘tribute’.<br /><br />§2 46 [ch]ā: ‘46 feet’. Chā is from Chin. chǐ 尺 ‘foot’. According to Archive 3/3.2 §2 every worker should pay 23 feet of silk cloth so Suhadatta and Kharamurrai paid 46 feet.<br /><br />§2 薩波深 莫 sàbōshēn mò / spāta śę’maki: Proper name. It seems that this Khotanese official drafted the Khotanese texts in the vouchers. As he is only attested in the vouchers he was probably from outside Cira-Six Town Prefecture and was sent from the court of the King of Khotan to this prefecture to collect the tribute cloth.<br /><br />§2 判官 pàn guān / phą11ni kvąni: ‘Administrative Assistant’ a high official in Khotan perhaps only second to the King of Khotan who was of course under the Tibetan Military Commissioner in Khotan at this point. More on this title see commentary on Archive 3/1.1 §8 (C).<br /><br />§2 富 惟謹 Fù Wéijǐn/hvų̄ : As analyzed in Archive 3/2 II. Formula Fu Weijin a Chinese official on the staff of the King of Khotan probably drafted the Chinese texts in the vouchers. He is also attested as one of the signatories in the bilingual order from the King of Khotan (Archive 3/1.1). More on him see commentary on Archive 3/1.1 §9 (C). <br /><br />d:<br /><br />§1 spāta vidyadatti: Proper name. According to Archive 3/2.7 §2 spāta Vidyadatta delivered another 37 feet of cloth three days later. He delivered 55.5 feet in total 9.5 feet more than the amount of cloth assigned to two workers.<br /><br />§6 senili: Proper name. Three days later on the 29th Senila he delivered d another 9.8 feet as recorded in Archive 3/2.10 §1 (K). In total he delivered 46 feet the amount assigned to two workers.<br /><br />§7 skarhve mā: ‘in the month of Skarhvāra (the 11th month)’. A shortened form of skarhvera māśtä.<br /><br />§7 sū: a misspelling of hvū corresponding to fù 富 the surname of Administrative Assistant Fu Weijin. The same mistake also occurs in Archive 3/2.5 §3. For more on Fu Weijin see commentary on Archive 3/2.3 §2. <br /><br />e-i:<br /><br />§2 Naṃdaki: Proper name also attested in Archive 3/2.1 according to which he paid 3000 mūrās into the treasury of ṣṣau An Sam.<br /><br />§3 [s]ū: a misspelling for hvū see commentary on Archive 3/2.4 §7. <br /><br />e-ii:<br /><br />§1 brūnade: Proper name. According to Archive 3/3.7 §10 Brūnade owes 20 feet. Here he repays his debt. <br /><br />f:<br /><br />§1 35 ṇi nävarabistamye haḍai: The dating formula in the Khotanese text is defective and out of place. 35 (kṣu)ṇä (skarhveri māśti) nävarabistamye haḍai ‘on the 29th of Skarhvāra (the 11th month) in the 35th regnal year’ is expected at the beginning of §5.<br /><br />§2 spāta vidyadatti: Proper name. Spāta Vidyadatta had delivered 18.5 feet of cloth three days earlier. See commentary on Archive 3/2.4 §1 (K).<br /><br />§3 Makali: Proper name also attested in Archive 3/1.14 §7 as from Āskūra and in Archive 3/1.26 §3 as Sudārrjāṃ’s former assistant (paśā).<br /><br />§4 Svarrjā: Proper name also attested in Archive 3/1.14 §7 as from Āskūra. <br /><br />g:<br /><br />§1 spāta vīsa: Proper name also attested in Archive 3/3.7 §5 where it is recorded that he owes 20 feet. Here he repays his debt and this payment is also recorded in Archive 3/3.1 §26.<br /><br />§2 家人: ‘dependent of the household’ corresponding to Khot. māśa-vīraa- referring to servants or slaves in a household. See commentary on Archive 3/1.25 §4.<br /><br />§2 puñadatti: Proper name also attested as ‘belonging to spāta Vīsa’ in Archive 3/1.24 §6. This attestation suggests that Puñadatta here is a dependent of Vīsa thus lending strong support to the identification of Chin. jiārén 家人 with Khot. māśa-vīraa-. This payment is recorded in Archive 3/3.1 §27. <br /><br />h:<br /><br />§1 spāta marṣi’: Proper name also attested in Archive 3/3.7 §4 as owing 20 feet of cloth.<br /><br />§2 ṣanīraki: Proper name also attested in Archive 3/3.2 §10 Archive 3/3.3 §12 Archive 3/3.5 §4 and Archive 3/3.7 §11 as owing 20 feet of cloth. Perhaps two men with the same name are involved here. <br /><br />i:<br /><br />§1 Senili: This is Senila’s second payment. His first payment of 36.2 feet is recorded in Archive 3/2.4 §6. In total Senila delivered 46 feet the amount assigned to two workers. <br /><br />j:<br /><br />§1 dīna: ‘under subordinate to’ corresponding to Chin. xià 下 attested again in Archive 3/5.3 §3. Zhang and Rong (1987 p.88) tries to interpret this word as a phonetic transcription of Chin. diǎn 典 ‘scribe official in charge of paperwork’ by assuming a series of scribal errors. This argument is far-fetched and untenable.<br /><br />§1 破沙宋闥下勿闥踵/pharṣa sudarana dīna vidarjū: ‘Vidarjū under pharṣa Sudara’ meaning Vidarjū was a subordinate of pharṣa Sudara who was none other than pharṣa Sāṃdara the recipient of most orders in Archive 3. In the Khotanese language at this stage āṃ and u/ūṃ were interchangeable just as Vidarjū is spelt Vidarrjāṃ in Archive 3/3.1 §28. For other instances see commentary on Archive 3/1.15 §12 Archive 3/1.24 §10 and Archive 3/1.26 §3. <br /><br />l:<br /><br />§1 sudarm(ä): Sudarma is attested not in Archive 3/3.1 but in Archive 3/3.7 §9 as owing 20 feet. Here Sudarma repays the outstanding amount. <br /><br />m:<br /><br />§1 nva thaunakāṃ: ‘According to the small silk cloth’. Bailey (KT IV p.31) reads: ‘hva thaunakā’. One can deliver thaunaka ‘small cloth’ in place of thau ‘(normal) silk cloth’. According to Archive 3/3.9 §3 3.2 feet of small cloth equaled to 23 feet of normal cloth. 36.2 feet of silk cloth is equivalent to 5.04 feet of small cloth.,KT IV: 30-31 106-109; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 252-271.

It can be inferred from his title ṣṣau that Cveṃdū was an official on the prefecture level or above. For more on ṣṣau see commentary on Archive 3/1.19 §1. Cveṃdū is not a Khotanese name probably a Chinese one.<br /><br />§4 pravanai: ‘register’. See commentary on Archive 3/1.15 §24.<br /><br />§6 haṣṭa: ‘eight’. Bailey (KT IV p.32) takes the blob before haṣṭa as a sign for 10 so that the numbers add up to 108 but there is no way that a blob can be a sign for 10. The problem can be solved by parsing cāṃṣṣī gyastä hīya as belonging to §7 also governing paśāta himya 10.<br /><br />§7 cāṃṣṣī: ‘Senior Secretary’ Chin. zhǎngshǐ 長史 most likely referring to Administrative Assistant Fu Weijin who is in Archive 3/1.1 §8 (C) bearing this title.<br /><br />§7 yauvarāyä: ‘the Crown Prince’ see commentary on Archive 3/5.12 §10.<br /><br />§8 haubarai: honorific of an official of a status similar to that of āmāca and associated with the king and the Young King. Also see commentary on Archive 3/5.20 §3.<br /><br />§8 dvīyāṃ āmācāṃ: ‘two āmācas’. In Archive 3 only ṣṣau Viṣṇadatta is attested with the honorific āmāca in Archive 3/1.4v §1 and Archive 3/1.19 §1. It is hard to conjecture who the second āmāca is.<br /><br />§9 hvaṃḍä himya sa Signum-H18 8: ‘there are 108 men. Signum-H18.’ 108 men have been enumerated. 52 + 15 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 13 = 108.<br /><br />§9 Signum-H18: This Signum is only in this document. Skjærvø (2009 p.132) suggests that this is ṣṣau Cveṃdū’s signum. This must not be the case since this document was issued in response to ṣṣau Cveṃdū’s order and ṣṣau Cveṃdū was mentioned in the third person. This signum must belong to the issuer of this document whose name is not attested.<br /><br />§10 stānaḍa: ‘superior teacher’. See commentary on Archive 3/1.21 §6. Yoshida (2006 p.124) understands the six stānaḍas mentioned here are included in ‘the 52 men according to the register’ in §4 and proposes that stānaḍa is the title of an official on the village level comparable to Khot. chaupaṃ Chin. chìbàn 叱半. For more on chaupaṃ see Wen Xin 2008a pp.143-144. These six stānaḍas however should not be understood as included in the 108 men enumerated above. The issuer of this document wrote §10 after his first signum because he forgot to count in these six stānaḍas. He then put a second signum after §10 to authenticate this modification. Postscript followed by a second signum is also seen in Archive 3/1.3 Archive 3/1.45 and Archive 3/4.6p three documents issued by Sudārrjāṃ.,KT IV: 32 117-119; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 435-437.

Bailey (KT IV p.32) reads: ‘namaubudhi’.<br /><br />§6 {brūnade thau hauḍi} 23 cha: This section is deleted by the scribe who wrote the nextrecord recognizable by his bold handwriting because the amount of cloth that Brūnade delivered is 20 feet not 23 feet. The correct amount is recorded in §11 corresponding to the voucherin Archive 3/2.6 §1.<br /><br />§8 thaunakāṃ: ‘small cloth’ corresponding to Chin. xiǎobù 小布 as attested in SI P 103.49(SDTV III p.156). The ‘small cloth’ is of higher value than normal cloth. One foot of small cloth’is worth 450 mūrās (Archive 3/3.4 §8) whereas the price of silk cloth is 62.5 mūrās per foot(Archive 3/3.9 §3). Duan (2013a p.310) identifies the small cloth with Chin. hújǐn 胡锦 ‘foreignbrocade’ and Tib. men dri in Hedin (Tibetan) 2 whereas Yoshida (2008a p.470) suggeststhat Tib. men dri is a translation of Khot. pe’mīnai thau and Chin. shīchōu 絁紬 ‘floss silkcloth’. For shīchōu 絁紬 see commentary on Archive 3/2.3 §1 (C).<br /><br />§8 ttraṃdi: ‘entered’ see SGS pp.40-41. In this context the verb ttrām- refers to converting thevalue of a small cloth into that of a normal cloth’. Compare Archive 3/3.8 §5 ‘naraṃda’ fromnarām- ‘to go out to convert (something) into money’.<br /><br />§8 4[ṣi’ vā th]au nva thaunakāṃ ttraṃdi: ‘[The following] cloth came in as small cloths.’Some men delivered small cloth in place of normal cloth. According to Archive 3/3.9 §3 3.2 feetof small cloth is equivalent to 23 feet of normal cloth.<br /><br />§11 byūnade: a scribal error for ‘brūnade’ see its corresponding voucher in Archive 3/2.6.<br /><br />§17 thau hauḍi 20 chā: Bailey (KT IV p.33) reads: ‘thau hauḍi 20 h<imye>’.<br /><br />§22 || pātci śe’ thau hauḍi 36 [chā 2] tsuna suhęna kamalä u sūradattä kamalä: ‘Then heagain delivered 36.2 feet of cloth on behalf of Suhena and Sūradatta.’ Bailey (KT IV p.120) noticesthe peculiar usage of ‘kamalä’ here but does not offer an explanation. Here kamala- ‘head’must mean ‘on behalf of’. Apart from suhęna kamalä u sūradattä kamalä §22 is identical withthe voucher in Archive 3/2.14 §2 in which Namaubuda is recorded as the payer. As every menshould deliver 23 feet (Archive 3/3.3 §2) two men should deliver 46 feet. Suhena and Sūradattajointly delivered 36.2 feet 9.8 feet short of the assigned amount. For each of them about 5 feetwas still outstanding as recorded in Archive 3/3.9 §5 and §6. Sūradatta later paid his debt asrecorded in the voucher in Archive 3/2.17 §2.<br /><br />§23 || cira haskadarmä [thau hau]ḍä {tcahau’si chā \23/} 23 chā: ‘Haskadarma from Cira delivered23 feet of cloth.’ Haskadarma is also attested in Archive 3/5.10 §2 Archive 3/5.12 §11 and Archive 3/6.1 §10. His payment does not correspond to any voucher in Archive 3/2. Instead we find a voucher of 20 feet of cloth by Sudarma on the 9th of the 12th month (Archive 3/2.13).This voucher does not correspond to any payment in the account either. Is it merely coincidentalthat both names end in -darma?<br /><br />§25 ysārī haṃbā: ‘by the amount of 1000 (string) of 1000 (mūrās)’. See commentary on Archive3/2.1 §2.<br /><br />§27 23 chā: ‘23 feet’. Bailey (KT IV p.33) reads: ‘33 chā’.<br /><br />§28 gūmaji vidarrjāṃ: ‘Vidarrjāṃ from Gūma’. In the corresponding voucher Archive 3/2.11 Vidarrjāṃ is identified as pharṣa sudarana dīna vidarjū ‘Vidarjū under pharṣa Sudara’. Gūma isa village in Āskūra. See commentary on Archive 3/5.22 §2. The attestation of Gūma here doesnot indicate by any means that it is on the same administrative level of Āskūra in §29 as ZhuLishuang (2013a p.46) understands it.<br /><br />§29 || ākvīra vasade thau hauḍä 18 chā 3 tsuna rrāhaji 19 mye haḍai: ‘Vasade from Āskūradelivered 18.3 feet of cloth on the 19th of Rrāhaja (the 12th month).’ The dating formula is followedby the sentence separator || so it must belong to this section not the following one. The four payments recorded in §29-§33 are not found in Hedin 16 since the last voucher in Hedin 16dates from the 7th day of the 12th month. These payments may have been recorded in freestandingvouchers similar to Archive 3/2.16.<br /><br />§30 || namaubudä thau hauḍi śau 39 chā 1 tsunä: ‘Namaubuda delivered one cloth 39.1 feetlong..’ Note that what Namaubuda delivered is one (piece of) cloth (thau) not one bolt (thauna).<br /><br />§34 tti cu sūlya gvaṣcāṃ[dä] thaunakyau jsa cu 53 (chā) nāṃdä: ‘This is what the Sogdianspaid by the small cloths of which they received 53 pieces.’ Those who could only produce smallcloths needed to convert their small cloth (thaunaka) into normal cloth (thau). The Sogdians deliverednormal cloth to the officials on behalf of these people in return for their small cloth. Accordingto Archive 3/3.8 §6 the Sogdians took 53 pieces of small cloth for seven bolts of normalcloth. Here I take one piece of small cloth as one foot of small cloth because that is the defaultunit measuring small cloth. One feet of small cloth is worth 450 mūrās (Archive 3/3.4 §8) andone foot of normal cloth is worth 62.5 mūrās (Archive 3/3.9 §3). 53 feet of small cloth wouldmake 53 × 450 = 23850 mūrās. Seven bolts of normal cloth would make 7 × 40 × 62.5 = 17500.Clearly the Sogdian made a considerable profit out of the deal.,KT IV: 32-33 119-120; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 283-287.

On the 21st of Braṃkhaysja Sudārrjāṃ received the order issued by the king on the 20th of Braṃkhaysja (§14). On the next day the 22nd of Braṃkhaysja (Archive 3/1.3 §10) Sudārrjāṃ copied this order from the king and issued his own order to his subordinates.

More on him in the introduction to Archive 3/1.41.<br /><br />§2 tsīṣī: ‘prefect’ head of a prefecture from Chin. cìshǐ 刺史. Cì 刺 LMC tshz̩ (Pulleyblank 1991 p.64) is polyphonetic. The other pronunciation tshz̩k preserved in Hakka and Cantonese today is reflected in MMP cygš’n cygšyy (Yoshida 1994 p.371 and Durkin-Meisterernst 2004 p.132) and perhaps JP cykšy cyk’šy (Yoshida 2016). Presumably the first pronunciation found its way into Khotanese directly from Chinese whereas the second pronunciation entered Uighur/ MMP/JP via a Sogdian intermediary .<br /><br />§2 tsīṣī spāta sudārrjāṃ: Prefect of the Cira-Six Town Prefecture. Most of the orders in Archive 3 were issued by him as testified by his signum at the end of the orders.<br /><br />§3[vaña v]ā tcirthū: ‘now here Military Commissioner’. Restored according to the standard opening formula of orders. This restoration also fits the length of the lacuna. Bailey (KT IV p.33) reads: ‘[v]ātci thūe’.<br /><br />§3 tcirthū: ‘Military Commissioner’ from Chin. Jiédù 節度 LMC tsiat tɦuə̆ (Pulleyblank 1991 p.83) a shortened form of Jiédùshǐ 節度使. Also attested as tcäräthū in Archive 3/1.12 §2 and tcirrtū in Archive 3/6.3 §2. Compare MMP syrtwš syrtwšyy from Chin. Jiédùshǐ 節度使. (Yoshida 1994 p.371) When the Tarim Basin was under Tang’s rule Khotan Kashgar and Kucha were all within the jurisdiction of the Anxi Protectorate whose headquarters were located in Kucha and whose military chief bore the title Jiedushi ‘Military Commissioner’. In other words Jiedushi was the military official of the highest rank in the entire Tarim Basin. In 760 the King of Khotan Viśa’ Vāhaṃ was appointed Jiédùfùshǐ 節度副使 ‘Vice Military Commissioner’ by the Tang government and continued to bear this title well into the period when Khotan was under Tibetan rule as is attested in Archive 3/1.1 §10 (C).<br /><br />§3 tcirthū lųnä ha’bäśi’rä: ‘Military Commissioner Blon Lha bzher’. It can be inferred from the title Jiedu that this Tibetan official was the military commander in charge of the southern Tarim Basin including Khotan and Kashgar. After conquering part of the Tarim Basin in the 790s the Tibetans inherited the Chinese title Jiedu and incorporated it into their own administrative system. In the northern Tarim Basin the Uighurs mirrored the Tibetans and appointed Uighur Jiedushis in Kucha and Beshbaliq. (Line 47 syrtwš and line 73 syrtwšyy in the Mahrnāmag. See Müller 1912 pp.10-11) The restored Tibetan name Lha zher is attested in Or.15000/187 (Takeuchi 1998 p.83.) in which Lha zher bears the title dgra blon ‘the commissioner of defense’. For more on dgra blon see Shen Chen 2016 p.223.<br /><br />§4 pāḍaki: pāḍaka- ‘document’. Pāḍa is the term for documents written on large wooden boxes such as Or.9268a (Catalogue p.67) and IOL Khot Wood 1 (Catalogue p.557). Almost all pāḍatype documents are contracts. Pāḍaka diminutive of pāḍa may refer to smaller documents written on wood. In Archive 3 pāḍaka-baraa- ‘document-carrier’ refers to those charged with the task of carrying such documents. See commentary on Archive 3/5.10 §3.<br /><br />§5 thihä tcyęnä: A title probably from Chin. Tèjìn 特進 LMC tɦəə̆k tsin (Pulleyblank 1991 p. 304 p.157) literally ‘(Lord) Specially Advanced’ a prestige title (sǎnguān 散官) of the second highest rank (Rank 2a). See Hucker 1985 p.490.<br /><br />§5 cigä lä thihä tcyęnä: ‘the Chinese Lä Tejin’ probably referring to Lǔ Yáng 鲁陽 the military chief of Kashgar (Zhènshǒushǐ 鎮守使) around 786 when Wú Kōng 悟空 passed through Kashgar on his way from India back to China. See Lévi and Chavannes 1895 p.362. Yoshida (2009 p.353) identifies this name with MMP lyfwṯwšy in Marhnāmag who has the title k’šyxšδ ‘Lord of Kashgar’.<br /><br />§6 khyeṣvā: ‘among the Kashgarian’ loc. pl. The locative singular form khyeṣa is attested in Archive 3/1.6 §2. For the identification of this word with Kashgar and its forms in other languages see KT VII p.50-54.<br /><br />§6 ą̄na: ‘from’ originally ā’ṇa- present participle of āh- ‘to sit dwell’ later particle emphasizing here and now and finally used as postposition. Dict. p.29.<br /><br />§6 lųnä tcabi ysaṃgä: ‘Blon Tsa-bzang’ only attested here and partially in §4. Lųnä from Tib. blon ‘minister’ indicates that this man was a Tibetan official.<br /><br />§6 lųnä tcabi ysaṃgä {hā}{ī} {ḍa} [hīvī] pīḍakä ā si: ‘An order from blon Tcabi Ysaṃga has come (saying)’. The scribe made some mistakes and deleted the last two akṣaras of line 4. Also compare with jasti hīvī parau ā si ‘an order of the King has coming (saying)’ in Archive 3/1.13 §5. Both Bailey (KT IV pp.33-34) and Skjærvø (2009 p.124) reconstruct differently.<br /><br />§7 huna: ‘Huns’ referring to the Uighurs. Also attested in Archive 3/1.5 §4. For the identification of the Huns with the Uighurs see Yoshida 2009 pp. 351-55.<br /><br />§7 ttuṃgaśeṃ: Place name exact location uncertain. Bailey (KT IV p.34) reads it as two separate words and suggests Uighur tonga ‘hero’ for ttuṃga in Dict. p.219 in the entry of parrya. But this is hardly plausible. Place names between Kashgar and Khotan at that time should not be in Turkic as the region was not yet under Uighur control.<br /><br />§7 parrya: parrīj- parräta- ‘to pass’ pf. intr. 3 pl. nom.-acc. pl. See Dict. p.219 not what Bailey proposes in KT IV p.123. Note the intransitive form.<br /><br />§8 [parr]y[a]: Restored according to parrya in the second half of §8. Bailey reconstructs: “[6ha]ḍ[ā]”.<br /><br />§9 phęmāña kītha: ‘The Fort in Phema’. See commentary on Archive 3/1.1 §5 (K).<br /><br />§10 au au: ‘every town’. Attested again in Archive 3/1.4 §2. The distributive usage of repetition is also found in hva hva ‘every man’ in Archive 3/1.6 §7 and bisi bisi ‘every village’ in Archive 3/1.45 §4.<br /><br />§11 buḍa: buḍara ‘more’ not the past participle of bar- ‘to carry’.<br /><br />§11 hāyarä: hāy- ‘to help’ impv. 2pl. Bailey (KT IV p.124) infers this meaning from the context but proposes ‘to send to forward’ in Dict. p.478. The latter meaning does not fit the context here. Skjærvø (2009 p.124) also renders this word as ‘*to help’.<br /><br />§12 tvaryari: tvar- ‘to bring in carry’ impv. 2pl. from *ati-bar- see KT IV p.124. Another form tvarīdä is attested in Archive 3/1.3 §7. The whole sentence corresponds to u jsārū jsāṃ parīya buḍä ‘order to carry your grain’ in Archive 3/1.3 §4.<br /><br />§14 Signum-SUa: This signum a shorthand of Sudārrjaṃ’s formal signature Signum-SU is used here to authenticate and mark the end of the quoted order from the King. It is attested again at the end of Archive 3/1.3 following the postscript after the end of the order and Sudārrjaṃ’s formal signature. This shorthand is used again in the same manner in Archive 3/4.17p and Archive 3/4.18p. <br /><br />b:<br /><br />§1 hārvāṃ: hārua- in the documents denotes an ‘official’ not ‘merchant’ as in the Buddhist texts gen. pl. See commentary on Archive 3/3.3 §4.<br /><br />§4 jsārū: jsār-ū ‘your grain’. Corresponding to jsārū jsa tvaryari ‘Transfer the grain with you’ in Archive 3/1.2 §12. Bailey (KT IV p.121) takes the second person plural enclitic-ū as the third person plural enclitic -ūṃ.<br /><br />§4 parīya: pary- ‘to order’ impv. 2pl.<br /><br />§5 ha[ysyar]ä: hays- ‘to send’ impv. 2 pl. Restored from context by Bailey (KT IV p.34).<br /><br />§6 pąmarīrau: OKh. patämar- ‘to inform’ impv. 2pl.<br /><br />§7 neri: nārä- ‘wife woman’ nom.-acc. pl. Here neri is the subject of the sentence just as daha hvaṃḍä ‘male men’ is also the subject. Bailey (KT IV p.121) takes both as objects.<br /><br />§7 nā’yīdä: nā’y- ‘to place’ pres. 3pl. from *ni-šādaya-. See Dict. p.186.§7 tvarīdä: tvar- ‘to bring in’ pres. 3pl. from *ati-bar-. See commentary on Archive 3/1.2 §12.<br /><br />§8 byehīme: byeh- ‘to obtain’ pres. 1s.<br /><br />§9 pa’jsa daula [ārri]: ‘severe punishment for wrongdoing’ restored by comparison with pa’jsä ārrä byehä ‘you will incur severe (punishment for) wrongdoing’ in Archive 3/1.1 §6 (K).<br /><br />§9 [hva]ryari: hvar- ‘to eat’ impv. 2pl. restored by Skjærvø (2009 p.125).<br /><br />§11 kūsi: kūsa- ‘drum’ Nom.-acc. s also attested in Archive 3/1.1 §1 (K) Archive 3/1.6 §2 and Archive 3/1.42 §3. Beating drums to signal alarms was a common practice in Khotan at that time and is reflected in a legend collected by Xuan Zang in his description of Khotan. According to the legend the King of Khotan once sacrificed one of his ministers to appease the river goddess and was therefore rewarded with the Dragon Drum a magical drum that would automatically sound if enemy were to approach. Though the mythical drum itself was no longer extant an abandoned Buddhist temple built by the side of the drum was still visible during Xuan Zang’s visit. (Xiyuji pp.1024-25) Stein (1907 p.227) identifies this temple with a mound called Naghara-Khāna ‘the house of kettle-drum’ not far from Yotkan the site identified with the capital city of Khotan.<br /><br />§11 ka’jarä: OKh. kalj- ‘to beat’ impv. 2pl.<br /><br />§12 aḍārye: aḍāra- ‘other’. Skjærvø (2009 p.125) observes that this word means ‘the Other’ referring to the enemy. This interpretation fits the context perfectly.<br /><br />§12 vyauli: ‘alarm’ OKh. vyāt/vula-. See KT IV p.125. Also attested in a similar context in Archive 3/1.6 §3.<br /><br />§12 yuḍāṃda: yan- ‘to do’ pf. 2 pl. tr. Bailey (KT IV p.121) translates this word in the future perfect. Skjærvø (2009 p.136 note 64) notices the inconsistency in Bailey’s translation but does not change it.,KT IV: 33-34 121-125; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 118-127.

Signum-VH <br /><br />v:<br /><br />§1 Document of equipment,§2 cira kṣvā auvā: ‘Cira-Six Town (Prefecture)’. For the name of the prefecture see commentary on piṣkala in Archive 3/1.1 §5 (K).<br /><br />§2 stānaḍāṃ: ‘superior teacher’ an honorific referring to monks. For more on this word see commentary on stānaḍa in Archive 3/1.21 §6.<br /><br />§2 pa[’ki]sanāṃ: ‘commoners ordinary people’ from Chin. baǐxìng 百姓. This restoration established that the lacuna after pa is only one akṣara long.<br /><br />§2 cira kṣvā auvā stānaḍāṃ vara u hamī[ḍa] pa[’ki]sanāṃ vara: ‘To the superior teachers in Cira-Six Town (Prefecture) and all the commoners’ or ‘to the monks and all the laymen in Cira- Six Town Prefecture’ simply meaning ‘everyone in the prefecture.’.<br /><br />§3 haṣḍi yuḍāṃda: haṣḍi yan- ‘to make a petition’ The subject of the verb is the stānaḍas and the residents in the Six Towns. In other words this order was responding to a petition concerning equipments that the stānaḍas had made to the King of Khotan on behalf of all the residents of the Six Towns. The stānaḍas must be in charge of military affairs.<br /><br />§4 phįmāṣṭau: from phįmāṣṭa-ū ‘to Phema for you’. Bailey (KT IV p.34) reads: ‘phęmāṣṭau’. Phema refers to the fort where the garrison was located. See commentary on phęmāña kīṃtha in Archive 3/1.1 §6.<br /><br />§4 pa[śa]: impv. 2s. Although this could be a direct quote from the stānaḍas’ petition to the king it is highly unlikely that the stānaḍas actually used the second person singular imperative to address the king. Perhaps the king was paraphrasing just as he did in §8.<br /><br />§5 vāśa’nai: ‘recitation reading’. According to the restoration of pa[’ki]sanāṃ in §2 at the end of line 1 only one akṣara is missing at the end of line 2. Bailey’s restoration (KT IV p. 34) ‘pa<śa nāma-> vāśa’nai ’ is too long and therefore unacceptable.<br /><br />§5 vāśa’nai pastiṃ pyūṣṭe: ‘I deigned to listen to its reading.’ In other words the king had the stānaḍas’ petition read aloud for him.<br /><br />§6 cvaṃ hā [x x x x]da: Bailey (KT IV p.126) reconstructs the whole sentence as cvam hā śtāka īda ‘because they are necessary for them’. Judging from the length of the lacuna this restoration is possible but the expected verbal form is īdi or īdä. Here -da indicates a verb in the second person plural past tense such as yuḍāṃda in §3.<br /><br />§7 ttyāṃ kiṇau: from ttyāṃ kiṇa-ū ‘concerning them (= the armors) for you’.<br /><br />§7 ttāguttau: ‘In the Tibetan language’. See KT IV p.126. The fact that the King of Khotan wrote a document in Tibetan shows that: 1) the document was sent to Tibetans; 2) the king was able to communicate in Tibetan either by himself or more likely via a scribe versed in Tibetan; 3) when this order was drafted in 798 CE Khotan was already under control of the Tibetans. Yoshida 2006 p.30.<br /><br />§8 dikhautta: ‘miserable’.<br /><br />§9 na [ra] yanīṃdä: “They (= the Tibetans) have not done (anything) yet.” Restored by analogy with Archive 3/3.3 §7: kṣau na ra byaidi ‘but the voucher has not been obtained’. This sentence is outside the quote of the document that the king sent to the Tibetans.<br /><br />§10 aurāśīrau: aurās- ‘to inform’ opt. 2pl.<br /><br />§11 śe’ siṃ[jsī]ṃ[jsä]: ‘the second (= intercalary) Siṃjsījsa (the fourth month)’ corresponding to Chin. rùn sìyuè 閏四月 in Archive 3/1.1 (C) §7. Siṃ the last preserved akṣara in line 5 is the key to the anchoring of Viśa’ Vāha’s regnal years onto an absolute chronology.<br /><br />§12 umi: ‘you’ G.-D. pl. governed by the participle of necessity tsuña.,KT IV: 34 125-126; ZHANG Zhan 2016: 232-234.

This word reminds one of ula-bāraa- ‘camel rider’ in §2 (K). But the two sentences do not correspond to each other.<br /><br />§1 (C) 桑宜本 Sāngyíběn: Chinese name of the Khotanese camel rider. Sāngyí 桑宜 is attested in Vaśi’rasaṃga’s Chinese name Wùrìsāngyí 勿日桑宜. See Yoshida 2006 p.27. The original Khotanese name of Sāngyíběn 桑宜本 can thus be restored as Saṃgapuña a name attested in Archive 3 (Archive 3/4.5p §3 Archive 3/4.6a §2 and elsewhere) but perhaps not referring to the same person.<br /><br />§1 (C) 口報 kǒubào: ‘to report orally’ as opposed to a written report.<br /><br />§2 (C) [鼓] gǔ: ‘drum’. Restored according to [k]ūsä in §2 (K). The upper left corner of the character is still visible. Drums were used to signal alarms in Khotan at that time. The camel-rider Saṃgapuña heard the alarm sounded by the drum in Shenshan and hurriedly came to report it. For more on the usage of drum see commentary on Archive 3/1.3 §11.<br /><br />§2 (C) 三舖人 sān pùrén: ‘three men of the relay posts’. Pù 舖 refers to the relay posts set up along the frontier approximately every 30 lis. Pùrén 舖人 men guarding these posts were charged with the task of warning the nearby town in case of enemy attacks. See Cheng 1991 pp. 230-39.<br /><br />§2 (C) 到 dào: ‘to arrive’. Reading uncertain. Zhang and Rong (1997 p.341.) leave this character unread. Here I follow Pulleyblank’s reading in KT IV p.136.<br /><br />§2 (C) 濡馬屈薩 Rúmǎqūsà: Place name exact location unknown. Duan (2012 p.75) first reads this phrase as a place name. She then identifies it with the Khotanese phrase written to its left phęmāña kīṃtha ‘the Fort of Phema’. Based on this identification she reads the first character as pèi 霈 and interprets the entire phrase as a phonetic transcription of phęmāña kīṃtha. Her insight that Pèimǎqūsà 濡馬屈薩 is a place is valuable but the rest of her argument is flawed because in this document the Chinese texts correspond to the Khotanese texts written to its right not to its left. As can be clearly seen in the translation phęmāña kīṃtha belongs to §5 of Khotanese which closely corresponds to §5 of Chinese and phęmāña kīṃtha corresponds to Kǎnchéng 坎城 ‘the fort of Kan’.<br /><br />§3 (C) 者 zhě: Marker of end-quote. See Wang Yongxing 1994 pp.423-442.<br /><br />§5 (C) 坎城 Kǎnchéng: ‘Fort of Kan’ corresponding to Khot. phemāña kīṃtha see below.<br /><br />§5 (K) piṣkala: ‘prefecture’ Chin. zhōu 州 Tib. tshan(d) referring to Cira-Six Town Prefecture attested in Khotanese as cira kṣvā auvā piṣkala ‘Cira-Six Town Prefecture’ (Archive 3/6.1 §2) or cira kṣvā auvā ‘Cira-Six Towns’ (Archive 3/1.3 §1 and elsewhere) or simply kṣvā auvā ‘in/of the Six Towns’ (Archive 3/1.21 §2 and elsewhere). Similarly the name of the prefecture is attested in Chinese as Zhìluó Liùchéng 質邏六城 ‘Cira-Six Towns’ in Дх.18940 (Zhang and Rong 2002 p.236) or Liùchéng Zhìluó 六城質邏 ‘Six Towns-Cira’ in Or.6406 (H.1) (Chavannes 1907 pp.521-524; Zhang and Rong 1987 pp.79-83) or simply Liùchéng 六城 ‘Six Towns’ in Archive 3/2.3 §1 (C) and elsewhere. Yoshida (2006 p.89 n.8) Wen Xin (2008b p.114) and Zhu Lizhuang (2013 p.73) take Liùchéng Zhōu 六城州 ‘Six Town Prefecture’ as the name of the prefecture whereas Rong (1993 p.405) tacitly uses both liùchéng Zhìluó Zhōu 六城質邏州 ‘Six Town-Cira Prefecture’ and Zhìluó Zhōu 質邏州 ‘Cira Prefecture’ to refer to this prefecture. In my opinion the official name of the prefecture is Zhìluó Liùchéng Zhōu 質邏六城州 ‘Cira-Six Town Prefecture’ corresponding to Khot. cira kṣvā auvā piṣkala meaning ‘the prefecture made up of six towns headed by Cira’ as Cira was the most important town among the Six Towns. Such a structure is parallel to Ānxī Sìzhèn Jiédù 安西四鎮節度 ‘the Military District of Anxi- Four Garrisons’ meaning ‘the military district made up of four garrisons headed by Anxi as Anxi (present-day Kucha) was the most important garrison among the Four Garrisons.<br /><br />§5 (K) phęmāña kīṃtha: ‘the Fort of Phema’ L. corresponding to Chin. Kǎnchéng 坎城. Tib. Kam sheng. The first syllable kǎn in Chinese and kam in Tibetan is a phonetic transcription of Khot. kaṃdva (Zhu Lishuang 2013 p.48). Duan (2012 p.77) points out that kaṃdva is attested together with Phema in Or.11344/8v (Archive 3/3.18 §3) and links it with khema in the Kharoṣṭhi documents. Phema on the other hand corresponds to Chin. Pìmó 媲摩 in Xuan Zang’s Xiyuji and Pein in Marco Polo’s Travels a place identified by Stein (1907 pp.462-463) with the site Uzun-tati. Especially noteworthy is the old fort that Stein (1907 p.462) visited and examined in the vicinity of Ulūgh-Ziārat about three miles to the southeast of Uzun-tati. According to Huang Wenbi (1958 p.48) who visited it in 1929 the local name of this fort is Kǎnàqìn 卡那沁. Li Yinping (1998 pp.255-262) convincingly identified this fort with Kǎnchéng 坎城 and interpreted its modern Uighur name as a phonetic rendering of its older Chinese name. When Khotan was under Tang control a relatively small garrison was stationed in Kancheng as a defense detachment (Shǒuzhuō 守捉 Khot. śūkṣuha see Yoshida 1997 p.568). The Tibetans continued to use this garrison as their military headquarters in the Six Towns. In the orders of Archive 3 phema ‘in Phema’ and kīṃtha ‘in the fort’ are often attested together with mara ‘here’ and vā ‘to us here’ (Archvie 3/1.33 §3 Archive 3/1.34 §3 Archive 3/1.39 §5 and Archive 3/1.42 §3) indicating that these orders were issued in the Fort of Phema and the issuers of the orders namely Sudārrjāṃ the prefect of Cira-Six Town Prefecture and Blon Rmang-bzher the Tibetan military officer were residing in the Fort of Phema. Also note that Phema was located in Cira- Six Town Prefecture but was not one of the Six Towns. For a list of the Six Towns see Wen Xin 2008b.<br /><br />§6 (C) 所由 suǒyóu: ‘official subordinate’ referring to the officials on a lower level. See Zhang and Rong 1987 p.87.<br /><br />§6 pa[’]jsä ārrä byehä: ‘you will incur severe (punishment for) wrongdoing.’ Compare Archive 3/1.3 §9: ‘pa’jsa daula [ārri hva]ryari’. Similar penalty clauses are found in Prakrit and Tumshuqese documents from Xinjiang. See Hitch 1998.<br /><br />§7 (C) 辰時 chénshí: ‘the hour of Chen (7-9 AM)’. According to §2 (C) the men from the relay post delivered the warning in the hour of mao (5-7 AM). Within a few hours this order was drafted and issued showing that the authorities in Khotan took the warning seriously and responded swiftly.<br /><br />§7 (C) 典 diǎn: ‘scribe official in charge of paperwork’. Also attested in Or.6406 (H. 1). See Zhang and Rong 1987 pp.87-88. But their identification of this title with Khot. dīna ‘under’ attested in Archive 3/2.11 §1 (K) is far-fetched and incorrect.<br /><br />§7 (C) 史懷仆 Shǐ Huáipú: Name of the scribe. Zhang and Rong (1997 p.340) leave the third character unread.<br /><br />§8 (C) 判官 Pànguān: ‘Administrative Assistant’ an important post in charge of paperwork on the staff of the Military Commissioner (Jiedushi). See Hucker 1985 p.363. This title is also attested as Khot. phąnä kvąnä (Archive 3/2 passim) JP pnkw’n (Zhang and Shi 2008 p.94) and MMP p’nxw’n (Yoshida 1994 p.371).<br /><br />§8 (C) 簡王府 Jiǎnwángfǔ: ‘Prince Jian’s Establishment’ also attested in Дх.18918.

Also attested as Khot. cāṃṣṣī in Archive 3/6.7 §7 (KT IV p.118) and MMP c’ngšyy (Yoshida 1994 p.371).<br /><br />§9 (C) 富 惟[謹] Fù Wéijǐn: Name of the Administrative Assistant. Together with a Khotanese official Fu Weijin issued most of the vouchers in Archive 3/2. See Archive 3/2 II.Formula. In accordance with the common practice at that time the Administrative Assistant signed his name Wéijǐn 惟謹 in a smaller font. See Rong and Zhang 1997 p.343.<br /><br />§9 (C) 節度副使都督王 jiédùfùshǐ dūdūwáng: ‘Vice Military Commissioner Governor King’ shortened title of the King of Khotan. His full title is Ānxī Sìzhèn Jiédū Fùshǐ 安西四鎮節度副 使 ‘Vice Military Commissioner of Anxi-Four Garrisons’ Píshā Dūdūfǔ Dūdū 毗沙都督府都督 ‘Governor of Pisha Governorate’ Yútián Wáng 于闐王 ‘King of Khotan’.
