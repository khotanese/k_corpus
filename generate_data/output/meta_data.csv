Zhìluó Liùchéng Zhōu 質邏六城州. See commentary on Archive 3/1.1 §5 (C).<br /><br />§2 nvā salī: ‘according to the year’ indicating that the amount listed below was the tax in grain for an entire year that is 11 kūsas 9 ṣaṃgas per man.<br /><br />§2 hvaṃḍä biśna 50 3: ‘53 men in total’. Compare the ‘53 men (including both) the commissioned and the non-commissioned’ in Archive 3/6.3 §4 the 58 men in Archive 3/1.7 §4 and the 52 men ‘according to the register’ in Archive 3/6.7 §4. 4! 24<br /><br />§3 ttāguttāṃ haudi śeṃgāṃ ṣaṃgna: ‘by the Tibetan seven-śeṃga ṣaṃga’. In the Tibetan system one ṣaṃga equals to 7-śeṃga. Here the issuer explicitly reminds the recipient of the Tibetan measurements because Sudārrjāṃ confuses the Tibetan seven-śeṃga ṣaṃga with the Chinese 10-śeṃga ṣaṃga in his calculation of grain in Archive 3/1.7. See introduction to Archive 3/1.7.<br /><br />§4 600 [30] [kūsa] 7 ṣaṃga: ‘630 kūsas 7 ṣaṃgas’. 11.9 kūsas per man × 53 men = 630.7 kūsas.<br /><br />§6 [100 80] 4 kūsa ganaṃ: ‘184 kūsas of wheat’. 630.7 − 225.4 − 221.3 = 184.<br /><br />§10 visarrjāṃ 50 2: ‘Visarrjāṃ 52 (years old)’. The number after the name of a man indicated the age of the man a common practice in registers. See Yoshida 2006 p.134.<br /><br />§10 vīṃgulą̄ ña ysāḍą̄ña: ‘From Vīṃgula’ ‘from Ysāḍa’. Vīṃgula and Ysāḍa are villages in Cira only attested here.<br /><br />§10 jīvvā khąṣṭarāṃ: ‘from Khaṣṭara among the Jīvas’ epithet of the name in the lacuna. Meaning unclear.<br /><br />§12 [biśna-ṃ jsārä] himi: ‘[All their grain] is …’ restored according to biśna jsārä himi in §4.<br /><br />§15 mattiśką̄ña dumesalą̄ña suhīkāña bikiną̄ña: ‘From Mattiśka’ ‘from Dumesala’ ‘from Suhīka’ ‘from Bikina’. Mattiśka Dumesala Suhīka and Bikina are villages in Birgaṃdara. Mattiśka is also in Archive 3/3.6 §14 Archive 3/5.3 §5 and Archive 3/5.22 §2. In Archive 3 Dumesala is only attested here but it is in BH 5-1 a newly-discovered wooden document in Khotanese. See Duan 2015 p.146. Suhīka is also in Archive 3/4.6a §2 Archive 3/4.6p §2 Archive 3/5.3 §3 and Archive 3/5.22 §2. Bikina is also in Archive 3/1.23 §2.<br /><br />§15 spą̄ñi: Place name a village in Birgaṃdara from spai- ‘to be rich prosperous’ attested again in Archive 3/6.8 §5. It is also in the epithet of Si Vidyadatta from Phaṃnai in §18 referring 4! 25 a village of the same name in Phaṃnai. The expected form is spą̄ña L.s. as in spāña sīlāṃ in §15.<br /><br />§16 sūlyą̄ña: a village in Pa’ L.s. from sūlya- ‘Sogdian’. This village is only attested here in Archive 3.<br /><br />§17 [āsk]u[ī]ra: ‘In Askūra’ parallel to ‘In Birgaṃdara’ in §15 ‘in Pa’’ in §16 and ‘In Phaṃnai’ in §18. A more common form is āskvīra such as āskvīra śī’laṃ ‘Śī’laṃ from Āskūra’ in Archive 3/4.13d §2. Wen Xin (2008b p.117 n.40) could not reconstruct this word and made a wrong conjecture.<br /><br />§17 puñiśela: puñiśāla- L.s. a village in Āskūra attested again as puñaśālyā in Archive 3/3.11 §6.<br /><br />§17 ba’sä vī: ‘upon ba’sa’. meaning unclear.<br /><br />§18 kulą̄ña buttaką̄ña: ‘From Kula’ ‘from Buttaka’.
